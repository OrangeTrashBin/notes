>There is, in Dr. Tillotson's writings, an argument against the real presence, which is as concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument can possibly be supposed against a doctrine, so little worthy of a serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.

在梯洛岑博士（Dr.Tilotson）的着作内有反对”神肉实在说“、（…RealPresence）的一种论证。对那样不值得认真反驳的一种学说，他那个论证也就够简洁，够精美，够有力了，别的较好的论证也就难以再找到了。

那个博学的教长说，人人都承认，那种权威，不论根据圣经或传说，都只是建立在圣徒们的证据上的，因为只有他们亲眼见过我们”救主“为证明他的神圣使命而行的那些神迹。因此，我们对基督教真…理所有的明验，不及我们对自己感官的真理所有的明验那样可靠；因为即在原始建立宗教的人方面，前一种明验也不比后一种大。那种明验如果再传给他们的信徒们，则它分明又要减弱一等。任何人之相信那些证据，都不及他们相信自己感官的直接对象。

一个较弱的明验也从不能消灭较强的明验，因此，神肉实在说纵然在圣经中明白给我们显示出来，而我们要相信它，那也是和正确的推论规则恰恰相反的。这种教条所根据的圣经和传说，我们如果只当它们是外部的证据看，而且我们如果不曾借圣灵的直接感动来心领神会它们，那它们的明验便没有感官的明验那样强烈。因此，那种教条是和我们的感官相冲突的。

>Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and free us from their impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.

这类论证是最中肯的，它至少定会把最僭越的迷信和偏执平息了，使我们免遭它们的鲁莽的诱惑。我敢自诩说，我也发明了一种与此相似的论证，而且我想，那个论证如果是正确的话，它在聪明而博学的人们方面，一定会永久防止住一切迷信的蛊惑，因此，世界只要存在，那个论证是永久有用的。

因为我想世界只要存在，则在神圣的和世俗的历史中，一定常有神迹和怪异的记载。

>Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.

在关于实际事情的推论方面，经验虽是我们的唯一的指导者，但是我们必须承认，这种指导者不能永久是无误的，在一些情形下，它是容易使我们陷于错误的。在英国的风土之下，某人如果预料在六月中的任何一个星期，比在十二月中的任何一个星期，天气较为晴美，那他的推论自然是正确的，而且也契合于经验，不过结果他也许会看到，自己竟然错了。

不过，我们可以说，他没有理由来抱怨经验，因为经验往往事前就借各种相反事情（我们可以借精勤的观察知道这一层）告知我们以它们的不确定性。一切结果并不同样确定地由它们的假设的原因而来。有些事情，在各国各代，人们都见它们是恒常在一块相会合的；有些事情是变化较多的，往往会挫沮我们的预期。因此，在关于实际事实的推论中，由最高度的确信到最低的可然证据，其间的信念程度是极参差不齐的。

>A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.

因此，一个聪明人就使他的信念和证据适成比例。在建立于无误的经验上的那些结论中，他以最高度的确信来预期将来的事情，他并且以他过去的经验作为那种事情将来要存在的证据。在别的情形下，他的推论就得较为谨慎一些。他要衡量各种相反的实验，他要考察那一造是被较多的实验所证实的，在找寻出那一造以后，他就带怀疑踌躇之态来倾向于那一造；即在最终他确定了自己的判断以后，那种明验也超不过我们所谓可然性（…Probability）。因此，可然性的含义就是在相反的各种实验和观察中有一造胜过其余一造，并且照那种优势产生出某种程度的一种明验来。如果一造有一百次实验或例证，另一造只有五十次，那我们对于任何事情的预期是很不定的；但是一百次一律的实验中如果只含有一个相反的实验，那我们就会合理地生起颇强的信念来。在一切情节下，我们必须把相反的各种实验平衡一下，并且从大数中减去小数，以便知晓较大明验的精确力量。

>To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of authority with us.

要把这些原则应用到一个特殊的例证上，那我们可以说，任何种推论都不及由他人证据得来的那种推论，都不及由亲身观察者的报告得来的那种推论更为寻常，更为有用，更为人生所必需。这种推论，有的人或者不承认它是建立在因果关系上的。我并不为字面来辩论。我们只可以说，我们所以相信这一类的论证，并非由于别的原则，只是因为我们观察过人类证据的真实，并且观察过事实和证人的报告常是相契合的。我们已经建立了一个概括的公理说，各种物象之间并没有可以发现出的联系，而且我们由此及彼的一切推测，都只是建立在我们所经验到的它们的恒常而有规则的会合上。

由此看来，我们不应该说，这个公理不能适用于人类的证据方面，因为人类证据和任何事情间的联系，也同别的联系一样是没有必然性的。记性如果不是有几分持久力的；人们如果都没有一种爱好真理的趋向，一种忠实无欺的秉性；他们如果在被人发现出自己的虚伪以后，都感不到羞耻；而且我们的经验也不曾证明这些性质是深植于人类天性中的；那我们就丝毫也不能相信人类的证据。一个精神错乱的人，或以虚伪和凶恶着称的人，对我们是没有丝毫权威的。

>And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or a probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the force of its antagonist.

由证人和人类报告得来的证据既然凭借于过去的经验，那么这种证据就是跟着经验变的，而且它之能成为证明或可…然性，也只是看某种特殊的报告和某种特殊的物象，其会合是恒常的，还是不定的。在这类判断中，有许多情节是应该考察到的；在决定这方面所起的争执时，我们所凭借的最后标准总是由经验和观察来的。这种经验如果在一方面不是完全一律的，那我们由此所生的判断中一定含有不可避免的相反情节，在其中一定有相反的论证可以抵消它的力量，一如在其他一切证据方面一样。我们对于他人的报告，往往要犹疑踌躇。我们要比较能引起疑虑和不定的那些互相反对的情节。我们如果发现了占优势的一造，那我们就倾向于它；不过我们的信念仍是会按照它的反对方的力量而减弱的。

>This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from human testimony.

在现在这种情形下，我们的证据可以由几种原因发生矛盾：或则由于有相反的证据与它对立；或则由于证人的品格不良，数目不多；或则由于他们提出证据的方式可疑；或则由于这些情节结合在一块。在各个证人互相矛盾时，在他们的人数稀少或品格可疑时，在他们说话有利可图时，在他们带着踌躇的样子提出他们的证据时，或正相反的，在他们带着狂猛专断的样子提出自己的证据时，我们对于他们所说的那种事情总要怀疑起来。此外还有别的许多同样情节，也可以减少或消灭由人类报告得来的任何证据的力量。

>Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion, which we perceive a priori, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.

现在我们如果假设，人类证言所要努力建立的那种事实是有几分奇特而神异的，则由那种证言所得来的明验便会跟着那件事情反常的程度之为大为小，按比例减低其力量。我们所以要信托证人和历史家，并非因为我们可以先验地在证言和实在之间看见有任何联系，乃是因为我们惯于看见它们互相契合。但是他们所要证明的事实如果是我们不常观察到的，那在这里便有两种相反的实验互相争斗起来。这两种实验都努力来互相消灭，至于优胜的一造也只能以所余的力量来影响人心。经验的原则虽使我们对于证人的证言有几分相信，可是这个原则在这种情形下同时使我们又有几分不相信他们努力所证明的这种事实。由这种矛盾，就必然使信念和根据之间生起一种平衡力来，使它们互相消灭了。

>I should not believe such a story were it told me by Cato, was a proverbial saying in Rome, even during the lifetime of that philosophical patriot.20 The incredibility of a fact, it was allowed, might invalidate so great an authority.

即在哲学的爱国者开途（Cato）生时，罗马就已有一个成语说：”这样一个故事，纵然是开途告知我的，我也不相信……它。“①。那时人已承认，一个荒诞的事实可以使那样大的权威失效。

>The Indian prince, who refused to believe the first relations concerning the effects of frost, reasoned justly; and it naturally required very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts, that arose from a state of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and which bore so little analogy to those events, of which he had had constant and uniform experience. Though they were not contrary to his experience, they were not conformable to it.

有一个印度的王子在初次听到人说到霜的作用时，他是不相信的，他的推理是很正确的。他所听说的那些事实虽是由自然的状态中生起的，可是他既然不熟习它们，而且它们和他恒常经验到的事情全不相似，所以非有很强的证据，不能使他相信。那些事实虽然和他的经验不相矛盾。

>But in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witnesses, let us suppose, that the fact, which they affirm, instead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; and suppose also, that the testimony considered apart and in itself, amounts to an entire proof; in that case, there is proof against proof, of which the strongest must prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its antagonist.

但是为使相反的可然性增加起来，以求驳倒证人的证据起见，我们还可以假设，他们确述的那种事情不只是奇特的，实在是神怪的；不过我们同时又可以假设，那个证据在其自身也够得上一个完全的证明。在这种情形下，两种证明就互相冲突起来；结果自然是最强的要胜利，不过它的势力仍然按照其反对方的力量而有所减少。

>A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is it more than probable, that all men must die; that lead cannot, of itself, remain suspended in the air; that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by water; unless it be, that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature, and there is required a violation of these laws, or in other words, a miracle to prevent them? Nothing is esteemed a miracle, if it ever happen in the common course of nature. It is no miracle that a man, seemingly in good health, should die on a sudden: because such a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has yet been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle, that a dead man should come to life; because that has never been observed in any age or country. There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as a uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of any miracle; nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof, which is superior.

一种神迹就是自然法则的破坏。我们的一种坚定的始终不变的经验既然已经把这些法则建立起来，所以反驳这个神迹的证明，（就事实的本性而论）,正和由经验所可能得到的任何强有力的证明是一样充分的。我们都相信一切人都是要死亡的；铅自身不能悬在空中；火会焚烧木头，会被水所熄灭。这些事情我们以为都是确然的，并不是或然的，因为这①很显然的，任何一个印度人都不曾经验到，水在冷的气候内是不结冰的。

>The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention), 'That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.' When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.

我们正可以给神迹下一个精确的定义说，”所谓神迹乃是借神明的一种特殊意志，或借一种无形作用的干涉，对自然法则的破……坏。“一个神迹也许可被人所发现，也许不能被人所发现，这变化不了神迹的本性。

由此看来，明显的结论应该是说（这是值得我们注意的一个概括公理）,”任何证据都不足以建立一个神迹，除非它的力量太强，使它的‘虚妄’比它所欲建立的那种事实更为神奇；不过即在这种情形下，两造的论证仍然可以互相消灭，而且较强的论证所能给我们的信念，也只是和减除了弱的力量后所余的力量相等。“某人如果告我说，他见一个死人复活，那我心里就会思考，他还是欺骗别人，或受别人欺骗的机会多呢？还是他所述的事情真正发生的机会多呢？我把各种神迹互相衡量，按照我所发见的优势，来下判断，而且我总要把较大的神迹排斥了。如果他的证据的虚妄比他所述的那件事更为神奇，那他才可以来命令我的信仰或信念，若非如此，那他休想使我信仰他。

PART II.
>In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed, that the testimony, upon which a miracle is founded, may possibly amount to an entire proof, and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy: But it is easy to shew, that we have been a great deal too liberal in our concession, and that there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence.

在前边的推论中，我们曾经假设，一个神迹所依以建立的那种证据，也有可能成为充分的证明，而且那个证据的虚妄会成为一种实在的怪异。不过我们必须承认，我们的让步太大了，而且从来没有任何一个神异的事情是建立在那样充分的一个证据上的。

>For first, there is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good-sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time, attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.

因为第一点，我们在全部历史中都不曾见有一个神迹是…被具有充分资格的多数人所证实的。我所谓充分的资格就是说，他们必须有毫无问题的见识、教育和学问，使我们相信他们不是自欺；他们必须有毫无可疑的忠实，使我们不能猜想他们有骗人的意思；他们必须在人看来有很大的声望，使他们在被人发现了自己的假造以后，就有莫大的损失；他们证明那些事情还必须进行于人所共见的方式中，还必须进行于世界上最着名的地方，因而使他们的假造（如果有的话）必然可以被人发现出来；要想使我们充分相信人类的证据，这些条件都是很必要的。

>Secondly. We may observe in human nature a principle which, if strictly examined, will be found to diminish extremely the assurance, which we might, from human testimony, have, in any kind of prodigy. The maxim, by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reasonings, is, that the objects, of which we have no experience, resembles those, of which we have; that what we have found to be most usual is always most probable; and that where there is an opposition of arguments, we ought to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations. But though, in proceeding by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in advancing farther, the mind observes not always the same rule; but when anything is affirmed utterly absurd and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits of such a fact, upon account of that very circumstance, which ought to destroy all its authority. The passion of surprise and wonder, arising from miracles, being an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events, from which it is derived. And this goes so far, that even those who cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately, nor can believe those miraculous events, of which they are informed, yet love to partake of the satisfaction at second-hand or by rebound, and place a pride and delight in exciting the admiration of others.

第二点，我们看到，人性中有一种原则，在严格考察之…后，我们会看到它能使我们由人类证据得来的神怪的信仰大为减低。在平常推理中我们所依以进行的公理是说，我们所未经验过的对象和我们所经验过的物象相似；我们所见的最寻常的事情恒常是最可然的；而且在各种论证互相对立时，我们应该选取那些建立在最多数过去观察上的论证。不过在依照这个规则进行时，我们虽然容易排斥非常的不可信的事实（不可信的程度不至太大）,可是在进得较远了以后，人心就常常不能遵守这个规则。在人们说出某件最荒谬最神异的事情以后，人心正因为那件事情中有那种能消灭一切根据的情节，来迅速地相信那种事情。由神迹而来的惊异和惊讶是快…人意的情绪，它容易使人有信仰那些事情的显着倾向，那种信仰即是由那些事情来的。这种情形是很厉害的，有些人纵然不能直接享受此种快乐，纵然不能相信他们所听到的那些神异的事情，他们也愿间接地借反响之力来分享那种快乐，而且他们如果能刺激起他人的羡慕来，他们还正要得意，还正要高兴。

>With what greediness are the miraculous accounts of travellers received, their descriptions of sea and land monsters, their relations of wonderful adventures, strange men, and uncouth manners? But if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder, there is an end of common sense; and human testimony, in these circumstances, loses all pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and imagine he sees what has no reality: he may know his narrative to be false, and yet persevere in it, with the best intentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause: or even where this delusion has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation, operates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other circumstances; and self-interest with equal force. His auditors may not have, and commonly have not, sufficient judgement to canvass his evidence: what judgement they have, they renounce by principle, in these sublime and mysterious subjects: or if they were ever so willing to employ it, passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of its operations. Their credulity increases his impudence: and his impudence overpowers their credulity.

我们不是看见，人们如饥如渴地相信了旅行家的神异记载，相信他们所叙述的海陆的妖怪，相信了他们所报告的奇事、怪人以及异样的风俗么？但是宗教的精神和好奇的心理如果结合起来，则常识便寿终正寝了；在这些情节下，人类的证据就再说不上还有任何根据了。一个宗教家也许是一个狂热者，他也许想像自己看到一种实际不存在的东西；他也许知道他自己的叙述是虚妄的，但是他为提倡圣教起见，还本着世界上最善良的意志来固执此说。

他纵然没有这种妄念，他的虚荣心也许被这样强的一种诱惑所刺激，来影响他，而且他所受的这种虚荣心的影响，要比别人在任何其他环境之下，都较为强烈。至于自私自利的心理，当然对他也有同样强烈的影响。

他的听众也许没有，而且寻常没有充分的判断，来考察他的证据。至于他们所仅剩有的判断，在这些崇高而神秘的题目中，他们也会照自己的主义把它排斥了。他们纵乐意运用自己的判断，而情感和热烈想像也会搅扰它的有规则的作用。因此听众的轻信就增加了他的厚颜，他的厚颜也征服了他们的轻信。

>Eloquence, when at its highest pitch, leaves little room for reason or reflection; but addressing itself entirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates the willing hearers, and subdues their understanding. Happily, this pitch it seldom attains. But what a Tully or a Demosthenes could scarcely effect over a Roman or Athenian audience, every Capuchin, every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind, and in a higher degree, by touching such gross and vulgar passions.

雄辩，在达到最高的程度以后，使理性和反省都没有运用的余地；它能完全引动人的想像或感情，所以它就可以禁锢情愿的听众，并且把他们的理解也征服了。

所侥幸的是，雄辩并不能常达到这种最高程度。但是一个西塞罗或一个德谟士（Demosthenes）所不能使罗马听众或雅典听众信服的事情，一个堪布秦教徒（……Capuchin）,一个巡行的或静立的宣教师，却可以因触动了一般人粗俗的情感，使他们更加相信。

>The many instances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and supernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detected by contrary evidence, or which detect themselves by their absurdity, prove sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind. This is our natural way of thinking, even with regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance: There is no kind of report which rises so easily, and spreads so quickly, especially in country places and provincial towns, as those concerning marriages; insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of propagating it, and of being the first reporters of it, spreads the intelligence. And this is so well known, that no man of sense gives attention to these reports, till he find them confirmed by some greater evidence. Do not the same passions, and others still stronger, incline the generality of mankind to believe and report, with the greatest vehemence and assurance, all religious miracles?

人们所假造的许多神迹、预言和超自然的事情，在历代都已经被相反的证据所揭破，或者被它们自身的荒谬所揭破。

但是人们还依然相信它们，因此，那就很可以证明一般人都很喜爱奇特的神异的事情，而且我们也正可以因此合理地来怀疑和此相似的一切传说。

这实在是我们思想的自然途径，即在最寻常最可信的事情方面，也是如此的。关于结婚的消息是最容易生起的，最容易传播的，在乡村和小镇中尤其是如此的。两个身分相等的青人还没有见了两次，全部邻居们就会把他们立刻结合在一块。这样一段有趣味的消息，人们觉得自己在传说它时，在传播它时，尤其在自己首先把它报告出时，是很快乐的；这种快乐之感就把这种新闻传播出去。

这种情形是人所熟知的，所以一个有常识的人非等有较大的证据把这些报告证实以后，往往不注意它们。这些情感以及别的更强的情感，不是使一般人极其狂烈地确然地来相信，来报告宗教的神迹么？

>Thirdly. It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them, that people will be found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors, who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend received opinions. When we peruse the first histories of all nations, we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new world; where the whole frame of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its operations in a different manner, from what it does at present. Battles, revolutions, pestilence, famine and death, are never the effect of those natural causes, which we experience. Prodigies, omens, oracles, judgements, quite obscure the few natural events, that are intermingled with them. But as the former grow thinner every page, in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages, we soon learn, that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case, but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous, and that, though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learning, it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature.

第三点，我们看到，一切超自然的神奇的传闻特别在无…知的野蛮民族为多，这一点也很可以成为反对这些事情的充分理由。至于文明的民族如果也相信了这类传说，我们就往往会看到，那个民族一定是从他们的无知的野蛮的祖先接受了这些传说的，因为那些祖先会以不敢触犯的敬仰和权威把那些传说传给他们，一如他们平常以不敢触犯的权威把别的传说信仰传给他们一样。当我们披阅一切民族的古史时，我们容易想像自己跑到一个新世界以内；在那里，自然的全部结构好像都解体了，而且各种元素的作用的方式好像都异于它现在的作用的方式。战争、革命、疫疠、饥馑和死亡，从来不是我们所经验到的那些自然原因的结果。

怪异、凶兆、神示和天罚，完全隐蔽了其中所掺杂着的少数自然的事情。不过我们愈进于开明的时代，则这些荒诞的事情在每一页中就愈稀少起来，所以我们很容易看到，实在并没有神秘或超自然的事情，人类所以以为有这些事情，只是因为寻常就有爱好神奇事情的倾向，而且因为这种趋向虽然也偶然受理智和学问的阻拦，但我们终久不能把它完全从人性中铲除掉。

>It is strange, a judicious reader is apt to say, upon the perusal of these wonderful historians, that such prodigious events never happen in our days. But it is nothing strange, I hope, that men should lie in all ages. You must surely have seen instances enough of that frailty. You have yourself heard many such marvellous relations started, which, being treated with scorn by all the wise and judicious, have at last been abandoned even by the vulgar. Be assured, that those renowned lies, which have spread and flourished to such a monstrous height, arose from like beginnings; but being sown in a more proper soil, shot up at last into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate.

一个聪明的读者，在披阅这些神异的历史家的记述时，往往容易说，”这类怪异的事情从来不曾发生于我们这个时代，……这真是奇怪的。“不过古往今来的人都是好撒谎的；这并不是……什么稀罕事。对于这个弱点，你一定见过许多例证。你一定常听到人们开始喧嚷许多这类奇异的事情，不过这种传说在被一切聪明人加以藐视以后，就是俗人们终久也把它们抛弃了。你可以相信，那些传遍远近的着名的谎言，也是由同样根源来的。不过它们因为播种在较适当的土壤以内，所以它们最后就成长为神怪事情，和它们所叙述的几乎相近。

>It was a wise policy in that false prophet, Alexander, who though now forgotten, was once so famous, to lay the first scene of his impostures in Paphlagonia, where, as Lucian tells us, the people were extremely ignorant and stupid, and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion. People at a distance, who are weak enough to think the matter at all worth enquiry, have no opportunity of receiving better information. The stories come magnified to them by a hundred circumstances. Fools are industrious in propagating the imposture; while the wise and learned are contented, in general, to deride its absurdity, without informing themselves of the particular facts, by which it may be distinctly refuted. And thus the impostor above mentioned was enabled to proceed, from his ignorant Paphlagonians, to the enlisting of votaries, even among the Grecian philosophers, and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in Rome: nay, could engage the attention of that sage emperor Marcus Aurelius; so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies.

那个曾经一度有名现在被人忘却的伪先知亚历山大曾经施行过一个聪明的权谋①，他把他的第一幕骗术演在帕夫拉贡尼亚（Paphlagonia）；据路绅（Lucian）告我们说，那地方的人民是极端愚蠢的，任何荒谬的骗局他们都会信以为真。

在远地方，那些信心不很坚定的人，虽然觉得这事值得考察一番，但是他们也没有机会来接受较可靠的消息。那些故事传到他们那里时，就已经因为许多情节愈形扩大了。傻子们努力来宣传那种骗术，至于聪明而博学的人们多半只是非笑其荒谬，却也不肯来寻求明确的事实，来明白地加以反驳。

①这个假先知生于世纪初。他散布流言说，亚波罗之子要重来世上。并且把一条小蛇装在鸡蛋内置于Aesculapius庙的基础下。
嗣后他又骗人说，那位神灵又要来临，因而他又使一条驯服的蛇戴上假的人头，绕在他的周围。他借种种骗术，赚了许多钱——译注。

因此，上边所述的那个欺骗者就可以借机在他那些无知的帕夫拉贡尼亚人以外，竟然在希腊哲学家和罗马显贵者之间找到信徒。

不但如此，他竟然能引动那位明王马克。鄂虑黎（MarAcusAurelius）的注意，使那位皇帝照他的伪预言来进行军事。

>The advantages are so great, of starting an imposture among an ignorant people, that, even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them (which, though seldom, is sometimes the case) it has a much better chance for succeeding in remote countries, than if the first scene had been laid in a city renowned for arts and knowledge. The most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry the report abroad. None of their countrymen have a large correspondence, or sufficient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the delusion. Men's inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to display itself. And thus a story, which is universally exploded in the place where it was first started, shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance. But had Alexander fixed his residence at Athens, the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning had immediately spread, throughout the whole Roman empire, their sense of the matter; which, being supported by so great authority, and displayed by all the force of reason and eloquence, had entirely opened the eyes of mankind. It is true; Lucian, passing by chance through Paphlagonia, had an opportunity of performing this good office. But, though much to be wished, it does not always happen, that every Alexander meets with a Lucian, ready to expose and detect his impostures.

在无知的人民之间来发起骗局，是很占便宜的，所以即使在那个骗局太明显而不为一般人所相信时（这事虽然是不……常见的，但偶尔也有）,它也可以在辽远的地方来蒙蔽人；反……过来说，它的第一幕如果演在素以艺术和学问着称的城市内，它就远没有那样好的机会。这些野蛮人中的最无知最野蛮的人们把这些消息带到外国去。

他们的国人又不是闻见很广的，也没有充分的声望和权威足以反驳和打倒那种骗局。

因此，人们的爱好稀奇的心向就有充分的机会可以表现出来。

因此，一个荒谬的故事虽在它的发生地被一般人所推翻以后它还能在几千哩以外被人认为是真实的。但是亚历山大如果卜居于雅典，则那个以学问着称的城市内的哲学家一定会立刻在罗马全国把他们对此事所抱的意见发表出去。他们的意见既然有那样大的权威，而且又加上理性和雄辩的全部力量，他们一定早已把全人类的眼光完全启开。诚然，路绅在偶然经过帕夫拉贡尼亚时，曾有机会来尽这种有益人群的职务。但是我们虽很希望每个亚历山大都遇见一个路绅来揭露他的骗局，可是这事情究竟是不常见的。

>I may add as a fourth reason, which diminishes the authority of prodigies, that there is no testimony for any, even those which have not been expressly detected, that is not opposed by an infinite number of witnesses; so that not only the miracle destroys the credit of testimony, but the testimony destroys itself. To make this the better understood, let us consider, that, in matters of religion, whatever is different is contrary; and that it is impossible the religions of ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, and of China should, all of them, be established on any solid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretended to have been wrought in any of these religions (and all of them abound in miracles), as its direct scope is to establish the particular system to which it is attributed; so has it the same force, though more indirectly, to overthrow every other system. In destroying a rival system, it likewise destroys the credit of those miracles, on which that system was established; so that all the prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as opposite to each other. According to this method of reasoning, when we believe any miracle of Mahomet or his successors, we have for our warrant the testimony of a few barbarous Arabians: And on the other hand, we are to regard the authority of Titus Livius, Plutarch, Tacitus, and, in short, of all the authors and witnesses, Grecian, Chinese, and Roman Catholic, who have related any miracle in their particular religion; I say, we are to regard their testimony in the same light as if they had mentioned that Mahometan miracle, and had in express terms contradicted it, with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate. This argument may appear over subtile and refined; but is not in reality different from the reasoning of a judge, who supposes, that the credit of two witnesses, maintaining a crime against any one, is destroyed by the testimony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues distant, at the same instant when the crime is said to have been committed.

此外还有第四种理由也可以减少神怪事情的权威。即在…那些未经人公然揭穿的神奇事情方面，任何一种证据也都有和它相反的无数的证见，因此，不止神奇事情本身能消灭证人的信用，而且那个证据也能消灭自己。为把这一点阐明起见，我们可以说，在宗教的事体方面，凡差别的都是相反的，而且古罗马、土耳其、暹罗和中国等国的宗教，一定不能统统建立在任何坚固的基础上。

这些宗教（它们都充满神迹）中任何一个所实现的各个神迹，其直接目的都只在于建立起那个神迹所属的那个宗教来，因此，它也有同样力量（虽然较为间接）来消灭其他任何体系。它如果能消灭一个敌对的体系，则它同时也就消灭了那个体系所依以建立的那些神迹的信用。因此，各个宗教中一切神异正可以认为是各种相反的事实，而且这些神异事情的证据，不论强弱，都是互相对立的。按这种推论方法说来，当我们相信穆罕默德或其继承者的神迹时，我们所根据的只有少数野蛮的阿拉伯人的证据；而在另一方面，则李维（TitusLivius）、扑鲁塔克（Plutarch）、塔西佗（Tacitus）以及希腊、中国、天主教中一切教主和证人，又都各各叙述其宗教中的神迹；所以我们在观察这些人的证据时，我们应该权当他们是叙述穆罕默德的神迹，权当他们用明白的话语断然地反驳了它，一如其断然地相信自己所述的那种神迹似的。

这个论证似乎是过于玄妙而细微的，不过实际上它也只仿佛像一个裁判官的推论。如果有两个证人控告某人有罪，同时又有两个证人确说，在对方所说”那种罪过发生的时候“,那个人却在哩以外，则某个裁判官便会假设，前两个证人的根据被后两个证人的证据推翻了。

>One of the best attested miracles in all profane history, is that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian, who cured a blind man in Alexandria, by means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot; in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis, who had enjoined them to have recourse to the Emperor, for these miraculous cures. The story may be seen in that fine historian23; where every circumstance seems to add weight to the testimony, and might be displayed at large with all the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous superstition. The gravity, solidity, age, and probity of so great an emperor, who, through the whole course of his life, conversed in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers, and never affected those extraordinary airs of divinity assumed by Alexander and Demetrius. The historian, a cotemporary writer, noted for candour and veracity, and withal, the greatest and most penetrating genius, perhaps, of all antiquity; and so free from any tendency to credulity, that he even lies under the contrary imputation, of atheism and profaneness: The persons, from whose authority he related the miracle, of established character for judgement and veracity, as we may well presume; eye-witnesses of the fact, and confirming their testimony, after the Flavian family was despoiled of the empire, and could no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie. Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, postquam nullum mendacio pretium. To which if we add the public nature of the facts, as related, it will appear, that no evidence can well be supposed stronger for so gross and so palpable a falsehood.

在一切世俗史中，经过多方证实的神迹，莫过于塔西佗所报告的维斯扑绅（Vespasian）的那个神迹。据说，这位皇帝在亚历山大港曾用其唾液治疗好一个瞎子，而且他的足一触动一个拐子，那个拐子也就治好了。据说，他施行这两次治疗，是遵着塞洛庇神（Serapis）的预示，那位神灵曾经吩咐那些人到那位皇帝那里，接受这些神奇的治疗。

这个故事，我们可以在那位名史家的着作中看到①。

在这里，各种情节似乎都给这个证据加了一种力量而且现在如果有人愿意给这个久已打破的迷信加强它的证据，那他正可以借雄辩和论证的一切力量，把那些情节扩大起来。那样伟大的一个皇帝，又严肃，又可靠，又高，又诚实，而且他在一生中和他的朋友同廷臣也只是照寻常的样子来谈话，并不曾装出奇特的神圣气概，如亚历山大和狄米特里（Demetrius）那样。至于那个史家，又是和那位皇帝同时的一个作家，他素以坦白和忠实见称，而且他在一切古人中或者是最大和最明敏的一个天才。他是完全不受”轻信“所影响的，所以人们竟然有相反的控诉，说他不信神明，妄加亵渎。至于他在叙述这件神迹时所根据的那些人，我们也可以猜想他们是富于判断，诚实不欺的；他们是亲眼见过那种事实的，而且他们在法洛维家族（FlavianFamily）失掉了皇权，不能给他们以撒谎的报酬以后，才来证实他们的证据（无论如何，在场的人都分明知道，后人对于他们的撒谎并不给任何奖酬）。此外，我们如果再说，这些事实是被人共见共睹的，如人所述的那样，那我们看到，对于这样彰明较着的一种虚妄事情，再没有比此更有力的一个证据，来证实它了。

①见塔西佗：《历史》

>There is also a memorable story related by Cardinal de Retz, which may well deserve our consideration. When that intriguing politician fled into Spain, to avoid the persecution of his enemies, he passed through Saragossa, the capital of Arragon, where he was shewn, in the cathedral, a man, who had served seven years as a door-keeper, and was well known to every body in town, that had ever paid his devotions at that church. He had been seen, for so long a time, wanting a leg; but recovered that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the stump; and the cardinal assures us that he saw him with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the canons of the church; and the whole company in town were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact; whom the cardinal found, by their zealous devotion, to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the relater was also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of great genius; the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit, and the witnesses very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, spectators of the fact, to which they gave their testimony. And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence, and may double our surprise on this occasion, is, that the cardinal himself, who relates the story, seems not to give any credit to it, and consequently cannot be suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He considered justly, that it was not requisite, in order to reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to disprove the testimony, and to trace its falsehood, through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which produced it. He knew, that, as this was commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place; so was it extremely difficult, even where one was immediately present, by reason of the bigotry, ignorance, cunning, and roguery of a great part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a just reasoner, that such an evidence carried falsehood upon the very face of it, and that a miracle, supported by any human testimony, was more properly a subject of derision than of argument.

雷茨主教（CardinaldeRetz,法国教士）也叙述过一个可纪念的故事，那个故事也颇值得我们来考察。当那个权谋的政治家逃到西班牙，以求避免其仇敌的杀戮时，他曾经过亚拉公（Aragon）京城萨拉哥萨（Saragosa）。他在那里一个礼拜堂内，有人就指给他一个人看。那个人曾在那里当了守门人，凡瞻礼过那个教堂的市民都知道他。多时以前，人们见他缺了一条腿，不过他在把圣油抹在那个残肢上以后，他又恢复了那条腿。那个主教向我们确说，他见那人有两条腿。那个教堂内的全体僧侣都曾把这个神迹加以证实；他又请求全体市民来证实此事，结果那个主教看到，他们都因为热心奉教统统相信这个神迹。

这个叙述故事的人和那个假设的怪事也是同时的，他的为人是不轻信的，不放荡的，并且是一个天才。这个神迹是很特殊的，很难容人假造，而且证人又很多，全体都有几分亲眼看见他们所证实的这件事。不但如此，而且最能增加证据的力量，使我们倍党惊异的，乃是，叙述这个故事的那个主教似乎并不相信这事，因此，我们也不能猜想他参与过这种神圣的骗局。他很合理地认为，要驳斥这类事实，我们无须乎有条有理地来驳倒它的证据，不必搜寻产生此事的一切欺骗和轻信的情节，来证明它的虚妄。他知道，在距离稍远的时间和地点，我们通常就不能搜寻到一切作伪的情节；因此，即使某人亲自在场时，他也很难以做到这一层，因为人类大部分是迷信的，无知的，狡滑的，欺诈的。因此，他就如一个正确的推理者似的断言说，这样一个证据使人一看就看出它是虚假的，而且任何人类证据所拥护的一个神迹，只是供人嘲笑的资料，而非辩论的题目。

>There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person, than those, which were lately said to have been wrought in France upon the tomb of Abb(c) Paris, the famous Jansenist, with whose sanctity the people were so long deluded. The curing of the sick, giving hearing to the deaf, and sight to the blind, were every where talked of as the usual effects of that holy sepulchre. But what is more extraordinary; many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses of credit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is this all: a relation of them was published and dispersed every where; nor were the Jesuits, though a learned body, supported by the civil magistrate, and determined enemies to those opinions, in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect them24. Where shall we find such a number of circumstances, agreeing to the corroboration of one fact? And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses, but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events, which they relate? And this surely, in the eyes of all reasonable people, will alone be regarded as a sufficient refutation.

关于个人所发生的神迹，为数最多的，莫过于近来法国人们盛传的巴黎方丈（AbéParis,法国神学家，生于，死于）墓上所发生的那些神迹。巴黎方丈是一个着名的詹森派，关于他的圣洁，人民是久已受了欺骗的。人们到处传说，那个圣墓有大的神力；类如治疗疾病，使聋者复聪，瞽者复明，乃是寻常的事情。不过最奇特的地方乃是：在这样一个开明的时代，在现今世界上这样一个卓越的舞台上，许多神迹竟然能在真诚可靠的裁判者面前当地立刻证明出来，被声名显赫的多数证人证明出来。还不止此，这些神迹的记载还被印行出来，分散在各地。耶稣教派虽然是被官吏所保…障的一个学者的团体，而且和那些神迹所赞助的那些信仰是死对头，但是他们也不能有条有理地加以驳斥，或把它们的真相揭穿。我们在什么地方能看到有这样多的情节凑在一起来证实一件事实呢？要想反对这样云涌般的证人，我们除了根据他们所述的事情的绝对不可能性，或神秘的性质以外，还有别的方法么？在一切明智的人看来，就只一样，也就足以成为充分的反驳了。

>Is the consequence just, because some human testimony has the utmost force and authority in some cases, when it relates the battle of Philippi or Pharsalia for instance; that therefore all kinds of testimony must, in all cases, have equal force and authority? Suppose that the Caesarean and Pompeian factions had, each of them, claimed the victory in these battles, and that the historians of each party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own side; how could mankind, at this distance, have been able to determine between them? The contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by Herodotus or Plutarch, and those delivered by Mariana, Bede, or any monkish historian.

我们能因为有些人类的证据在一些情节下（类如在它叙述菲利贝或法沙利亚战争时）有绝大的力量和权威，就断言说，一切人类的证据在一切情节下，都有同样的力景和权威么？假定凯撒党和庞培党各各都声言他们在这些战事中是胜利的，而且各党的诸历史家都一致记述自己的党是胜利的；那么，我们生活于千之后的人如何能决定他们的是非呢？希罗多德（Herodotus）或扑鲁塔克（异教徒）所记载的神迹，同马里亚纳（Mariana）、比德（Bede,基督教徒）或任何僧侣历史家所记载的神迹，其间的矛盾正是一样有力的。

>The wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favours the passion of the reporter; whether it magnifies his country, his family, or himself, or in any other way strikes in with his natural inclinations and propensities. But what greater temptation than to appear a missionary, a prophet, an ambassador from heaven? Who would not encounter many dangers and difficulties, in order to attain so sublime a character? Or if, by the help of vanity and a heated imagination, a man has first made a convert of himself, and entered seriously into the delusion; who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds, in support of so holy and meritorious a cause?

一个聪明人对拍合于报告者的情感的任何报告，总是存疑的，不论那个报告是来赞扬自己的国家，自己的家庭，或报告者自己，也不论它是在别的方面能拍合他的自然的倾向和天性。但是要当一个从天上来的使者、先知、和大使，那种诱惑不是大过别的一切诱惑么？

谁不愿意冒万险，经大难，以求来充当这样崇高的一个角色呢？而且一个人如果因虚荣心和狂热想像力的帮助，使自己先相信了自己，认真地将无作有，他还能不决心利用虔诚的骗术来拥护那样一个神圣而有价值的事业吗？

>The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame; because the materials are always prepared for it. The avidum genus auricularum25, the gazing populace, receive greedily, without examination, whatever sooths superstition, and promotes wonder.

在这里，星星的火花会燃成最大的火焰；因为燃料常常是准备好的。贪听消息的耳朵和张目注视的民众，往往不经考察就贪婪地接受了凡能拍合其迷信、助长其惊异的任何消息。

>How many stories of this nature have, in all ages, been detected and exploded in their infancy? How many more have been celebrated for a time, and have afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion? Where such reports, therefore, fly about, the solution of the phenomenon is obvious; and we judge in conformity to regular experience and observation, when we account for it by the known and natural principles of credulity and delusion. And shall we, rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution, allow of a miraculous violation of the most established laws of nature?

我们不是看见在各时代有许多这一类的故事在一产生出来就被人揭穿了，驳斥了么？我们不是看见有更多的故事曾传遍一时，以后就消沈了，被人忽略，被人忘记么？

因此，在遇到这一类传闻散布时，解决这类现象的方法是很明显的；我们正可用”轻信“和”欺骗“那两个人所共知的自然原则来解释它，而且我们这种判断是合乎有规则的经验和判断的。

难道说，我们不求助于这种自然的解释，而允许最确定的自然法则被神迹所破坏么？

>I need not mention the difficulty of detecting a falsehood in any private or even public history, at the place, where it is said to happen; much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a distance. Even a court of judicature, with all the authority, accuracy, and judgement, which they can employ, find themselves often at a loss to distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent actions. But the matter never comes to any issue, if trusted to the common method of altercations and debate and flying rumours; especially when men's passions have taken part on either side.

对任何私家历史甚或公家历史的荒谬事实，不用说，即在人们所传说的那个事实的发生地，我们也很难把它揭穿出来；至于发生此事的地点如果稍为远一点，那更是困难了。

一个法庭虽有莫大权威，虽然侦察准确，虽然判断得当，他们也有时茫然不知所措，不能分辨出最近发生的行动是真是假。

但是我们如果信托普通争论和口角方法和流言，那我们永远不会得到结果，尤其在人们的情感有所偏袒时更是如此。

>In the infancy of new religions, the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the season is now past, and the records and witnesses, which might clear up the matter, have perished beyond recovery.

在新的宗教方生之初，聪明而博学的人们往往觉得那事无关重要，不值得注意。可是到了后来，他们纵然愿意揭穿骗术，以提醒受骗的群众，但是时机已经过去了，而且能揭露此事的那些记载和证据已经消灭了，不可挽回了。

>No means of detection remain, but those which must be drawn from the very testimony itself of the reporters: and these, though always sufficient with the judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar.

因此，要想揭穿这类事情的虚妄，我们并没有别的方法，只能根据报告者的证据本身所推求出的那种方法；这些方法对聪明而有学识的人虽是很充足的，但是它们是过于精致，不容易被俗人所了解的。

总括起来看，我们可以说，任何神迹的证据从来连”可然性“的地步也达不到，至于证明的地步，那更是达不到的。

>Upon the whole, then, it appears, that no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much less to a proof; and that, even supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be opposed by another proof; derived from the very nature of the fact, which it would endeavour to establish. It is experience only, which gives authority to human testimony; and it is the same experience, which assures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore, these two kinds of experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other, and embrace an opinion, either on one side or the other, with that assurance which arises from the remainder. But according to the principle here explained, this substraction, with regard to all popular religions, amounts to an entire annihilation; and therefore we may establish it as a maxim, that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle, and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion.

我们纵然假设它可以成为证明，但是它仍然会被另一个证明所反对；那另一个证据正是由它所努力确立的那种事实的本性中推出来的。使人类证据得到权威的，只有经验，但是同一经验又使我们相信自然法则。因此，这两种经验如果相反起来，那我们没有别的方法，只能由这一个经验中减去另一个经验，而且我们不论接受那一面意见，我们的确信程度也只能同所余的力量相应。但是按照我们在这里所解释的原则说来，在通俗的宗教方面，两相抵消之后，就等于它完全消灭了；因此，我们就可以确立一个公理说，任何人类的证据都没有充分的力量来证明一个神迹，使它成为任何宗教体系的一个正当基础。

>I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I say, that a miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a system of religion. For I own, that otherwise, there may possibly be miracles, or violations of the usual course of nature, of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony; though, perhaps, it will be impossible to find any such in all the records of history. Thus, suppose, all authors, in all languages, agree, that, from the first of January 1600, there was a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days: suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among the people: that all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the same tradition, without the least variation or contradiction: it is evident, that our present philosophers, instead of doubting the fact, ought to receive it as certain, and ought to search for the causes whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and dissolution of nature, is an event rendered probable by so many analogies, that any phenomenon, which seems to have a tendency towards that catastrophe, comes within the reach of human testimony, if that testimony be very extensive and uniform.

但是我虽然说，我们并不能证明一个神迹，使它成为任何宗教体系的基础，不过我这个话也有一层限制。因为我承认，在别的情形下，也竟可以有神迹，也竟可以破坏自然的寻常途径，而且它们也竟可以被人类的证据所证明，——虽然我们在全世界的史书中或者找不到这样一回事。假定方言不同的各国的一切作者都一致记载说，在月日以后，全地球上有天整个是黑暗的；又假定这个奇事的传说在民间还是很有势力，家喻户晓；假定由外国归来的一切旅客都给我们带来同样传说，而并无丝毫的差异或矛盾，——在这种情形下，我们现在的哲学家不但不应怀疑此事，而且应该认它是真实的，应该来考察这件事情所以发生的原因。

自然的衰落、损坏和解体这件事，我们很可以借许多类似情节来证明它是可然的，所以任何现象只要有趋于此种灾祸的倾向，都是人类的证据可以证明的——如果那个证据是普遍的而且一律的。

>But suppose, that all the historians who treat of England, should agree, that, on the first of January 1600, Queen Elizabeth died; that both before and after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole court, as is usual with persons of her rank; that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament; and that, after being interred a month, she again appeared, resumed the throne, and governed England for three years: I must confess that I should be surprised at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other public circumstances that followed it: I should only assert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor possibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the difficulty, and almost impossibility of deceiving the world in an affair of such consequence; the wisdom and solid judgement of that renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice: All this might astonish me; but I would still reply, that the knavery and folly of men are such common phenomena, that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence, than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature.

但是我们如果假定，一切历史家在写英国史时都一致记载说，在月日，伊丽莎白女王（QuenElizabeth）死了；而且在她死前和死后都曾被医生和廷臣所见（这种情形，在像她这类身分的人，是一件寻常事）,而且她的继承人也被国会承认了，正式宣布了；可是她在葬埋了一个月以后，忽然又出现了，复了位，并且又统治了英国之久——如果他们这样记载，那我可以自白说，我所惊异的只是：那么多的奇特情节如何会凑合在一块，可是我一定没有丝毫倾向来相信这样神奇的一件事。我对于人所说的她的死亡和与此相伴的许多公共情节，也并不怀疑，不过我要确说，她的死是假的，那种死在实际上既不是真的，也不可能是真的。你或者会反对我说，这事情也太难做假，而且在这样一件重要的事情方面来欺骗世人，那几乎是不可能的；你或者还会说，那个着名的女王是有智慧的，是有坚强判断力的，而且她也不能由这样可怜的一个伎俩得到任何利益。这些情节自然都可以使我惊异，但是你这种反驳仍然无效。我仍然可以答复说，人类的欺诈和愚痴乃是一种寻常的现象，所以我宁愿相信这些最奇特的事情只是起于他们的共同作伪，而不承认自然法则会这样显着地被破坏了。

>But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion; men, in all ages, have been so much imposed on by ridiculous stories of that kind, that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat, and sufficient, with all men of sense, not only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it without farther examination. Though the Being to whom the miracle is ascribed, be, in this case, Almighty, it does not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; since it is impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being, otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions, in the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation, and obliges us to compare the instances of the violation of truth in the testimony of men, with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles, in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony, and make us form a general resolution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever specious pretence it may be covered.

但是你如果把这种神迹归于任何一个新的宗教体系，那我们也可以说，人类在一切时代既然都常被那类可笑的故事所欺骗，所以单单这种情节就足以充分证明其欺骗，而且这种情节不只可以使一般有见识的人来排斥此种事实，并且还可以使他们不经考察就来排斥此种事实。在这里，人们虽把那个神迹归之于神明，而且那个神明在这种情形下是全能的，但是这种事情却不能因此成为有几分可然的；因为我们并没有别的方法可以知道这样一个神明的各种属性或动作，我们只能借我们在自然途径中所经验到的”他“的那些产品，来知道他的属性或动作。这又使我们复返于过去的观察，使我们不得不比较研究，看看还是人类的证据常常违反事理呢，还是神迹常常破坏自然法则呢？并且看看那一种例子是较为可能的，较为可然的呢？在宗教神迹的证据方面，比在别的事实的证据方面，违反真相的事情既然是较常见的，这种情节就大可以减弱前一种证据的权威，并且使我们下一次总的决心，不再来注意它——不论它有什么冠冕堂皇的饰词。

>Lord Bacon seems to have embraced the same principles of reasoning. 'We ought,' says he, 'to make a collection or particular history of all monsters and prodigious births or productions, and in a word of every thing new, rare, and extraordinary in nature. But this must be done with the most severe scrutiny, lest we depart from truth. Above all, every relation must be considered as suspicious, which depends in any degree upon religion, as the prodigies of Livy: And no less so, every thing that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy, or such authors, who seem, all of them, to have an unconquerable appetite for falsehood and fable26.'

培根勋爵（LordBacon）似乎奉行过同样的推论原则。

他说：”对于自然中一切妖异，一切怪胎或怪物以及一切新奇反常的事物，我们都应加以搜集，给它们做成一部特殊的记载。

不过我们在作此工作时，必须有极其严格的考察，免得离了真相。最重要的是，凡和宗教稍有关系的一切叙述，我们都可以认为是可疑的，就如李维（Livy）所记载的那些怪诞的事情。就是在自然幻术或炼金术一类的作者方面，或在一切爱造谣爱作伪的一切作者方面我们对于他们的记载也应一样怀疑。“（见《新工具》卷26，箴言）。

>I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here delivered, as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguised enemies to the Christian Religion, who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is founded on Faith, not on reason; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is, by no means, fitted to endure. To make this more evident, let us examine those miracles, related in scripture; and not to lose ourselves in too wide a field, let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the Pentateuch, which we shall examine, according to the principles of these pretended Christians, not as the word or testimony of God himself, but as the production of a mere human writer and historian. Here then we are first to consider a book, presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people, written in an age when they were still more barbarous, and in all probability long after the facts which it relates, corroborated by no concurring testimony, and resembling those fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely different from the present: Of our fall from that state: Of the age of man, extended to near a thousand years: Of the destruction of the world by a deluge: Of the arbitrary choice of one people, as the favourites of heaven; and that people the countrymen of the author: Of their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing imaginable: I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after a serious consideration declare, whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book, supported by such a testimony, would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relates; which is, however, necessary to make it be received, according to the measures of probability above established.

这里所述的这种推论方法，我是很喜欢的，这种方法正可以驳倒基督教的那些危险的朋友或乔装的仇敌，因为他们…正想借人类理性的原则来拥护基督教。我们的最神圣的宗教是在信条上建立着的，并非是在理性上建立着的。我们如果…使基督教来经受它所经不起的试验，那正足以揭露它的弱点…为阐明这一点起见，我们可以考察圣经上所叙述的那些神迹。

为使我们不至迷失于太广的范围内起见，我们可只就摩西五…经所记载的那些神迹说。我们可以按照这些自命的基督教徒。

的原则，来考察这些记载，我们可以认它们不是上帝自己的语言或证据，只认它们是世俗作家和历史家的作品。

在这里，我们首先看到，这部书是由一个野蛮而无知的民族提供给我们的，它是在他们更野蛮的时候写的，而且写的时候多半是在所叙述的事实发生了好久以后，而且所记载的事实又不曾被一致的证据所证实，而且它们只仿佛是各民族记载其起源时所述的那些荒诞的事实。其次，在读了这部书以后，我们又看到其中充满了许多怪异和神迹。它记载着完全同现在不一样的世界状况和人类状况；它记载着人类由这种状况降落下来的事实；他记载着将近千岁的人类的龄；它记载着洪水毁灭了世界的那种事实；它记载着上帝曾经任意选了一个他所钟爱的民族；它记载着与作者同国的那些人民；它记载着他们曾借最惊人的神迹使他们脱出羁绊。我希望任何一个人把他的手置在他的胸前，并且在认真地思维之后来公开宣称，他是否以为这样一个证据所支持的这样一部书，是假造的，而且此书之为假造是否比它所叙述的一切神迹还要奇特，还要神异。

我们如果想按照上述的可然性的尺度来信受它，那此书之为假造必须比其所叙述的神迹还不可想像，才能被我们所信奉。

>What we have said of miracles may be applied, without any variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all prophecies are real miracles, and as such only, can be admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretell future events, it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven. So that, upon the whole, we may conclude, that the Christian Religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: And whoever is moved by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.

我们如果想按照上述的可然性的尺度来信受它，那此书之为假造必须比其所叙述的神迹还不可想像，才能被我们所信奉。

在神迹方面所说的那些话，也可以完全照原样，把它们实用在先知的预言方面。实在说来，一切预言都是真正的神迹，而且人们所以能认预言是任何默示的证明，也只是因为它们是神迹。预言未来如果不是人性的能力所不能及的一件事，而人们如用任何先知预言来证明来自上天的神圣使命或权威，那就很荒谬了。

因此，总括起来，我们可以断言说，基。

督教不只在一开始是带有许多神迹的，而且即在现在任何有理性的人离了神迹也不能相信它。只有理性并不足以使我们相信基督教的真实；任何人如果受了”信条“的鼓励来相信基督教，那他一定会亲身体验到有一个继续不断的神迹，这个神迹会推翻他的理解中的一切原则，并且使他来决心相信最与习惯和经验相反的事情。
