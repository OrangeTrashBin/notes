# Main
## Operating	System
- Software that makes computer easier to use 
    - Broadly, for the user to interact with programs
    - For the programmer to use machine’s resources 
    - Resources: CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices, ...
-  Improves the computer’s capabilities 
   -  Performance: speed, efficiency 
   - Reliability: correctness, fault tolerance 
   - Security: privacy, authenticity, integrity

## Kernal
###  Operating System vs. the Kernel
- “Operating system” has many interpretations
    - E.g., all soLware on machine minus applications  
- Our focus is much more limited: the kernel
    -  All programs depend on it, accessed via sys calls 
- Works closely with hardware
    - Accesses device registers, responds to interrupts 
- Allocates basic resources
    - CPU time, memory space, use of I/O devices

###  Two Purposes of the Kernel
- To provide abstract machine
  - Interface for the programmer 
  - Functions and resources 
  - Goals: simplicity, convenience
- To manage resources
  - All the mechanisms and policies 
  - Allocates usage: space and time 
  - Goals: performance, reliability, security
- Summary:  Turn Undesirable into Desirable
  - Undesirable inconveniences of reality ...
    - Complexity of hardware
    - Single/limited number of processors 
    - Small/limited amount of memory
  - Desirable conveniences: illusions
    - Simple, easy-to-use resources
    - Multiple/unlimited number of processors
    - Large/unlimited amount of memory
### Three Key Ideas
 -  Abstraction
      - What is the desired illusion
  -  Mechanism
      - How to create illusion: basic functionality 
      - Fixed: works one way, the only way
  - Policy
      - Which way to use mechanism, to meet a goal
      - Variable: many possible, select best for situation
