>I was lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes; where, though he advanced many principles, of which I can by no means approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear some relation to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this enquiry, I shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as I can, in order to submit them to the judgement of the reader.

我近来同爱好怀疑主义僻论的一个朋友谈过一次话。谈话时，他所提出的许多原则虽是我所绝不同意的，但是它们既然似乎很奇怪，且和我在此书中的全部推理连锁有关，所以我要在这里尽记忆所能及的范围把它们照原样抄录下来，以求读者的判断。

>Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of philosophy, which, as it requires entire liberty above all other privileges, and chiefly flourishes from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation, received its first birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration, and was never cramped, even in its most extravagant principles, by any creeds, concessions, or penal statutes. For, except the banishment of Protagoras, and the death of Socrates, which last event proceeded partly from other motives, there are scarcely any instances to be met with, in ancient history, of this bigotted jealousy, with which the present age is so much infested. Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age, in peace and tranquillity: Epicureans27 were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character, and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred rites of the established religion: And the public encouragement28 of pensions and salaries was afforded equally, by the wisest of all the Roman emperors29, to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How requisite such kind of treatment was to philosophy, in her early youth, will easily be conceived, if we reflect, that, even at present, when she may be supposed more hardy and robust, she bears with much difficulty the inclemency of the seasons, and those harsh winds of calumny and persecution, which blow upon her.

在我们谈话之初，我就对于哲学所特享的好运气很表示羡慕。哲学之需要完全的自由甚于它需要别的特权，而且它所以能够繁荣，多半是因各种意见和辩论可以互相自由反对。

恰好它的出生正在于爱自由尚容让的一个国家，一个时代；而且它的最狂妄的原则也不曾受过任何教条、任何官许、任何刑法的限制。

因为除了普洛泰高洛斯（Protagoras）的放逐和苏格拉底的毒死而外（后边这件事实还有别的动机）,我们在古代历史中几乎找不到任何一种顽固妒忌事例，如现在世人到处所传染的那样。

伊壁鸠鲁安静地和平地在雅典活到高龄，至于伊壁鸠鲁派还又得到祭司的身分，在雅典人那个久已确立的宗教中最神圣的祭礼时，他们还可以在祭坛上来行祭典①。

至于罗马皇帝中最聪明者②还对各派哲学家，平均给以金或薪俸，以收公家提倡之效。我们很容易想到，在哲学的幼小时期，这种照顾是很必要的，因为我们一反省就可以看到，即在现在，人们虽认它已是结实的、健壮的，可是它还很难经受起险恶的天气和向它吹来的毁谤和杀戮的暴风。

①见Luciani:《对话集》（Symp）和《拉比泰人》（aiLapitai）。

②见Luciani:《太监论》（Eununchs）,又见Diogenes:《哲学家传记集》。

>You admire, says my friend, as the singular good fortune of philosophy, what seems to result from the natural course of things, and to be unavoidable in every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of which you complain, as so fatal to philosophy, is really her offspring, who, after allying with superstition, separates himself entirely from the interest of his parent, and becomes her most inveterate enemy and persecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the present occasions of such furious dispute, could not possibly be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate, formed an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension, and composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as were the objects of traditional belief, more than of argument or disputation. After the first alarm, therefore, was over, which arose from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers; these teachers seem ever after, during the ages of antiquity, to have lived in great harmony with the established superstition, and to have made a fair partition of mankind between them; the former claiming all the learned and wise, the latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.

我的朋友说，你所羡慕的哲学的这种好运气，似乎是自然的结果，而且在各时各地都是不可免的。你所抱怨的并且以为有害于哲学的这种顽强的偏执，实在是哲学的子嗣，它和迷信结盟以后，就完全不顾它母亲的利益，变成了她的最难化解的仇敌和杀戮者。在世界的初期，人们想像不到现在引起狂烈争辩的宗教中那些思辩的教义。那时候的人民因为完全不识文字，所以他们的宗教观念也只适合于他们的微弱的理解，而且他们的神圣教条也多半成立于传统信仰的战事，而不成立于争论和辩难。至于哲学家的新的怪论和原则，一开始它们虽然也使人感到惊慌，可是这种惊慌过去以后，古代这些教师们似乎一向和确立的迷信处于极其谐和之中，而且他们和迷信平均领有了人类；哲学家领有了博学而聪明的人们，迷信则领有一切俗人和文盲。

>It seems then, say I, that you leave politics entirely out of the question, and never suppose, that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy, such as those of Epicurus, which, denying a divine existence, and consequently a providence and a future state, seem to loosen, in a great measure, the ties of morality, and may be supposed, for that reason, pernicious to the peace of civil society.

于是我就说道，你似乎完全忽略了政治而不谈它，而且你似乎从未假设，一个聪明的官吏可以合理地戒备某些哲学的教条——如伊壁鸠鲁的那些教条。我所以说伊壁鸠鲁的教条是应当戒备的，乃是因为它否认有神圣的存在，因而否认有天意和来世，因而使道德的维系力大为涣散，因而又使人们假设它们是有害于文明社会的平安的。

>I know, replied he, that in fact these persecutions never, in any age, proceeded from calm reason, or from experience of the pernicious consequences of philosophy; but arose entirely from passion and prejudice. But what if I should advance farther, and assert, that if Epicurus had been accused before the people, by any of the sycophants or informers of those days, he could easily have defended his cause, and proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries, who endeavoured, with such zeal, to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy?

他答复说，我知道，事实上，这些杀戮在任何时代，都不曾起于平静的理性，也不是因为人们经验过哲学的有害的影响；它们之所以发生完全是由于情感和偏见。但是我或者可以进一步说，那时的进谗者如果在人民面前把伊壁鸠鲁控…告了，他或者容易为他自己辩护，或者可以证明，他的哲学原则和其反对者的原则是一样有益的，——虽然那些反对者以极大热忱，把他暴露在公众的憎恶和妒忌之前。假如我能这样说，那又该怎样办呢？

>I wish, said I, you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a topic, and make a speech for Epicurus, which might satisfy, not the mob of Athens, if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contained any mob, but the more philosophical part of his audience, such as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.

我答复，如果是这样，那我希望你在这样一个特别的题目上把你的辩才逞露出来，发表一篇拥护伊壁鸠鲁的演说。

这样，你的演说纵然不能说服雅典的暴民（如果你承认那个文明古城中也有暴民）,或者可以说服那些较富有哲学思想，并估计可以了解他的论证的听众。

>The matter would not be difficult, upon such conditions, replied he: And if you please, I shall suppose myself Epicurus for a moment, and make you stand for the Athenian people, and shall deliver you such an harangue as will fill all the urn with white beans, and leave not a black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries.


他又答复说，在这些条件之下，这件事不难做到。如果你愿意的话，那我可以暂时把我当做一个伊壁鸠鲁，把你当做雅典人民，并且向你发表一篇雄辩。我相信我的雄辩足以使全体人民投我的票，而不至有一人投反对票来满足我的仇敌的恶意。
原作 人民一定会用白大豆装满了缶，而不留一个黑大豆来满足我的仇敌的恶意——按希腊人古时是用大豆投票的，如毕达哥拉斯劝其门徒免用大豆，就是诫其勿参政之意）。

>Very well: Pray proceed upon these suppositions.

好罢，就请你照这些假设往下说罢。

>I come hither, O ye Athenians, to justify in your assembly what I maintained in my school, and I find myself impeached by furious antagonists, instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers. Your deliberations, which of right should be directed to questions of public good, and the interest of the commonwealth, are diverted to the disquisitions of speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but perhaps fruitless enquiries, take place of your more familiar but more useful occupations. But so far as in me lies, I will prevent this abuse. We shall not here dispute concerning the origin and government of worlds. We shall only enquire how far such questions concern the public interest. And if I can persuade you, that they are entirely indifferent to the peace of society and security of government, I hope that you will presently send us back to our schools, there to examine, at leisure, the question the most sublime, but at the same time, the most speculative of all philosophy.

诸位雅典人啊，我来此处，是要在诸位的集会中把我自己在我的学院中所主张的教条，加以辩正，但是我看到，我自己乃是被狂怒的反对者所攻击非难，而不是同平静而不动感情的一些研究者在一块推论。诸位的心思是该用在公共幸福和社会利益的问题上的，现在却是把它们旁用在思辩哲学的研究上了；而且诸位已经使这些庄严的（但是或者无用的）研究，来代替诸位的较寻常较有用的本业了。不过我总要尽我自己的能力来防止这种精力的滥用。我们在这里且不争论世界的起源和结构。我们只来研究，在何种范围内，这类问题是和公共利益有关系的。如果我能使诸位相信，这类问题和社会的和平、政府的安全概无关系，那我希望，诸位可以立刻把我们遣回学院，使我们在那里得以从容考察那种最崇高而又最思辩的哲学。

>The religious philosophers, not satisfied with the tradition of your forefathers, and doctrine of your priests (in which I willingly acquiesce), indulge a rash curiosity, in trying how far they can establish religion upon the principles of reason; and they thereby excite, instead of satisfying, the doubts, which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry. They paint, in the most magnificent colours, the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask, if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms, or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire. I shall not examine the justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire. It is sufficient, if I can prove, from this very reasoning, that the question is entirely speculative, and that, when, in my philosophical disquisitions, I deny a providence and a future state, I undermine not the foundations of society, but advance principles, which they themselves, upon their own topics, if they argue consistently, must allow to be solid and satisfactory.

宗教的哲学家不满意祖先的传说和僧侣的教义（这些我都是相信的）,所以他们就纵容他们的粗鲁的好奇心，来试探他们在何种范围内可以把宗教建立在理性的原则上。他们这样努力的结果，反而刺激起人们在精细考究时所自然生起的那些怀疑，却不曾把它们消释了。他们用最庄严的辞藻来描绘宇宙的秩序、美丽和聪明的设计。

于是他们就进而问道，这样光荣的智慧的表现是否可以由原子的偶然会合而来，而且所谓偶然的机会是否可以产生出最大的天才所惊羡不已的宇宙。这种论证是否正确，我不在这里加以考察。我愿意承认这个论证正有我的反对者同控诉者所期望的那样坚牢。我只愿意根据他们的这种推论来证明，这个问题是完全属于思辩方面的，而且我在我的哲学的研究中否认天意和来世时，我不至把社会的基础颠复了，只是提出了他们也不能不承认的一些原则——那些原则即就他们的论点而言，他们也必然承认是坚牢的，满意的，如果他们的推论能首尾一贯的话。现在我只要能证明这一点，那就够了。

>You then, who are my accusers, have acknowledged, that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence (which I never questioned) is derived from the order of nature; where there appear such marks of intelligence and design, that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause, either chance, or the blind and unguided force of matter. You allow, that this is an argument drawn from effects to causes. From the order of the work, you infer, that there must have been project and forethought in the workman. If you cannot make out this point, you allow, that your conclusion fails; and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of nature will justify. These are your concessions. I desire you to mark the consequences.

诸位控诉者啊，诸位已经承认，神圣存在（我毫不怀疑这一层）的主要论据或唯一论据是由自然的秩序推出来的，而且诸位以为，在分明有标记来表示出智慧和设计的地方，要把它的原因归之于机会，或盲目而没有指导的物质势力，那是妄诞的。诸位承认，这是由结果到原因的一种论证。根据作品的秩序，诸位就推断说，工人一定有设计和预想。如果诸位不能阐明这一点，则诸位承认，诸位的结论是错误的。

此外，诸位也并不妄想在自然现象所能许可的范围以外，来建立诸位的结论。

这都是诸位所许可的。

请诸位看看这种结果如何。

>When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must proportion the one to the other, and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause any qualities, but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect. A body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof, that the counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces; but can never afford a reason that it exceeds a hundred. If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect. But if we ascribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of producing other effects, we can only indulge the licence of conjecture, and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies, without reason or authority.

当我们根据结果来推测任何原因时，我们必须使原因和结果适成比例，而且我们所归于原因的各种性质只限于恰能产生那个结果所需要的，在此以外，我们绝不许妄认它有别的性质。一个十盎司重的物体在天秤上被举起后，就可以证明在另一头可以平衡它的那个法码是重于十盎司的，但是却不能给我们任何理由，使我们说那个法码重于百盎司。我们给某个结果所找出的原因如果不足以产生它，那我们或则抛弃那个原因，或则给它加上必需的一些性质，使它和那个结果有了正确的比例。但是我们如果说它除了必需的性质以外还有别的性质，或者说它可以产生出别的结果来，那我们只是任意瞎猜，并且没有任何理由和根据，就妄来假设有各种性质和能力。

>The same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be brute unconscious matter, or a rational intelligent being. If the cause be known only by the effect, we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities, beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the effect: Nor can we, by any rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause, and infer other effects from it, beyond those by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely from the sight of one of Zeuxis's pictures, could know, that he was also a statuary or architect, and was an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colours. The talents and taste, displayed in the particular work before us; these we may safely conclude the workman to be possessed of. The cause must be proportioned to the effect; and if we exactly and precisely proportion it, we shall never find in it any qualities, that point farther, or afford an inference concerning any other design or performance. Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what is merely requisite for producing the effect, which we examine.

在我们所推寻出的任何原因上，都可以适用这个规则，不论这个原因是蠢然的无知的物质，或是有理性有智慧的实有。

如果原因只能借结果被我们所知晓，则我们在原因上，除了产生此结果所必需的性质以外，再不能妄加别的性质；而且按照正确的推论规则，我们并不能再由这个原因返回来，在我们知道此原因时所凭借的那些结果以外，再推断有别的结果。

一个人在只看见蔡克斯（Zeuxis）的图画以后，无论如何不能知道，他还是一个雕刻家或建筑家，无论如何不能知道，他在石头和大理石方面也和在颜色方面一样是名手。他的才能和趣味是表现在我们面前这个特殊的作品上的，我们可以确实断言，这些都是那位艺术家所具有的。

原因必须和结果适成比例，而且我们如果使它恰好和结果精确地成比例，那我们绝不能在其中见有任何别的性质，使我们据以进一步来推断它还有别的设计或动作。那一类性质一定不只是产生我们所考察的那种结果时所需要的性质，而是已经超过那些性质了。

>Allowing, therefore, the gods to be the authors of the existence or order of the universe; it follows, that they possess that precise degree of power, intelligence, and benevolence, which appears in their workmanship; but nothing farther can ever be proved, except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning. So far as the traces of any attributes, at present, appear, so far may we conclude these attributes to exist. The supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis; much more the supposition, that, in distant regions of space or periods of time, there has been, or will be, a more magnificent display of these attributes, and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues. We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe, the effect, to Jupiter, the cause; and then descend downwards, to infer any new effect from that cause; as if the present effects alone were not entirely worthy of the glorious attributes, which we ascribe to that deity. The knowledge of the cause being derived solely from the effect, they must be exactly adjusted to each other; and the one can never refer to anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference and conclusion.

我们纵然承认，诸位神灵曾创造了宇宙的存在或秩序，我们也只能说，他们恰好只具有他们作品中所表现的那种能力、智慧和仁慈，但是我们却不能在此以外更有所证明，——除非我们求助于夸张和谄媚，来补充推证和推论的不足。在当下，我们看到有什么痕迹可以表示出某种属性来，而我们只能在所见到的范围内来断言，这些品德是存在的。要说还有别的属性，那只是一种无根据的假设；至于要说，在某种辽远的地方或其个悠远的时期，这些属性曾有或将有更灿烂的表现，而且曾有或将有更适于这些想像中德性的一种宇宙的鸿图；那更是一种无根据的假设。我们绝不能由作为结果的宇宙升到作为原因的鸠壁特，并且再由此原因降下来推断出别的结果来。这样，我们就是以为只有现在这些结果还不足以完全表现我们所给与那位神灵的那些光荣的属性。关于原因的知识既然只是由结果来的，所以它们必须恰好互相适应。

而且不论果或因都不能指示出别的东西，也不能成为任何新推测和新结论的基础。

>You find certain phenomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You imagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamoured of this offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things, which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this superlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or, at least, without any foundation in reason; and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any qualities, but what you see he has actually exerted and displayed in his productions. Let your gods, therefore, O philosophers, be suited to the present appearances of nature: and presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions, in order to suit them to the attributes, which you so fondly ascribe to your deities.

诸位在自然中找到一些现象，诸位就找寻一个原因或创造者。诸位想像自己找出了他。随后诸位又爱上了诸位脑中这个子嗣，所以诸位就想像他一定还产生了比现在的事物状况更伟大更完美的一种景象，现在的事物状况是那样充满了灾患和纷乱的。诸位忘掉了这种无上的智慧和仁慈完全出于想像，或者至少说在理性中是没有基础的。诸位忘了，诸位并没有什么根据，可以在他在其作品中所实在施展出、表现出的性质以外，再赋与他以别的性质。诸位哲学家啊，诸位要让诸位的神灵适合于现在的自然现象才是。诸位不要妄想来用任意的假设把这些现象变化了，使它们适合于诸位极愿归于神灵的那些属性。

>When priests and poets, supported by your authority, O Athenians, talk of a golden or silver age, which preceded the present state of vice and misery, I hear them with attention and with reverence. But when philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority, and to cultivate reason, hold the same discourse, I pay them not, I own, the same obsequious submission and pious deference. I ask; who carried them into the celestial regions, who admitted them into the councils of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate, that they thus rashly affirm, that their deities have executed, or will execute, any purpose beyond what has actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason, and by drawing inferences from effects to causes, I still insist, that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination; otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference, and argue from causes to effects; presuming, that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as the gods, and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute, but what can be found in the present world.

雅典人啊，当诸君的威望所支持的，僧侣和诗人谈述在充满了罪恶和灾患的现世界以前久已存在的那个黄金时代或白银时代时，我是很专一地、很恭敬地静听他们的。但是哲学家既然自夸是忽略了权威而专来培植理性的，所以当他们作同样的谈话时，我对他们就不能同样谄媚屈从和虔诚恭敬了。我问他们说，谁把他们带到天界里？谁把他们请到诸神的会议内？

谁向他们把命运之书打开？

谁使他们鲁莽断言说，他们的神灵在现实的情况以外曾经实行过或将来要实行任何别的计划呢？如果他们告我说，他们之往上推想，或是凭借于理性的逐渐上升，或是凭借于由果及因的推测，那我仍然可以说，他们仍是借想像的翅膀来帮助理性的上升的。否则他们不会变更他们的推断方式，来由原因推出结果；否则他们便不会谬想比现世界更完美的一种产品，才能较合于所谓神灵的那一种完美的实有，否则他们便不会忘掉，他们并没有理由，在现实世界所有的完美属性而外，再给这些天神以别的完美品德。

>Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of nature, and save the honour of the gods; while we must acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder, with which the world so much abounds. The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter, we are told, or the observance of general laws, or some such reason, is the sole cause, which controlled the power and benevolence of Jupiter, and obliged him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy. These attributes then, are, it seems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their greatest latitude. And upon that supposition, I own that such conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as plausible solutions of the ill phenomena. But still I ask; Why take these attributes for granted, or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the effect? Why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions, which, for aught you know, may be entirely imaginary, and of which there are to be found no traces in the course of nature?

因此，我们虽然枉费辛苦解释自然的恶劣现象，挽救诸位神灵的光荣，可是都是白费的，因为我们不得不承认，现世界上所充满的那些罪恶和纷乱都是实在存在的。人们又告诉我们说，鸠壁特的权力和仁慈所以受了限制，使他不得不把人类或一切有情都造得那样不完美，那样不幸福，唯一的原因只在于物质有一种顽强而不可克服的性质，或在于他必须遵循概括的规则，或者因为有别的原因。由此看来，他们已经预先假设了这些属性（权力和仁慈）是最大的了。根据这个假设，我也可以承认，这类猜想或者可以似是而非地解释恶劣的现象。不过我仍然要问：为什么要预先假设这些属性，或者为什么要在结果中所实际呈现的性质以外，再给原因以别的性质呢？这些假设诸位既然也知道不免是完全想像的，而且我们在自然中并不能给它们找寻出任何踪迹来，那么诸位又为什么煞费脑汁，借这些假设来辩护自然的途径呢？

>The religious hypothesis, therefore, must be considered only as a particular method of accounting for the visible phenomena of the universe: but no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact, and alter or add to the phenomena, in any single particular. If you think, that the appearances of things prove such causes, it is allowable for you to draw an inference concerning the existence of these causes. In such complicated and sublime subjects, every one should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and argument. But here you ought to rest. If you come backward, and arguing from your inferred causes, conclude, that any other fact has existed, or will exist, in the course of nature, which may serve as a fuller display of particular attributes; I must admonish you, that you have departed from the method of reasoning, attached to the present subject, and have certainly added something to the attributes of the cause, beyond what appears in the effect; otherwise you could never, with tolerable sense or propriety, add anything to the effect, in order to render it more worthy of the cause.

因此，我们必须把宗教的假设只看做是解释宇宙中有形现象的一种特殊的方法；不过一个正确的推理者从不会在任何一个特殊例证中，妄图根据这个假设来推测任何事实，或把现象变化了，或在其上有所增益。如果诸位觉得，事物的现象可以证明这些原因，那关于这些原因的存在，诸位也不妨有一种推测。在这种复杂而崇高的题目方面，人人都可以尽量自由地来有所推测，有所论断。

不过诸位必须停在这里。

如果诸位返回来，根据诸位所推求出的原因来断言说，在自然中，有别的事情曾经存在过，或将要存在，并且以为这种事实可以较充分地表现出特殊属性来，那我必须警告诸位说，诸位已经离弃了现在这个题目方面应有的推论方法，而且在结果中实际所表现的属性以外，诸位又给原因加上了别的一些属性。否则诸位只要稍有常识，稍懂规矩，万不能在结果之上加一些东西，以便使它更能表现原因的完美。

>Where, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine, which I teach in my school, or rather, which I examine in my gardens? Or what do you find in this whole question, wherein the security of good morals, or the peace and order of society, is in the least concerned?

那么我在自己学院中所教人的那种教条，或我在自己花园中所考察的那种教条，究竟有什么可以取憎于人的地方呢？

诸位在这个丝毫不影响良好风俗的安全同社会的秩序及和平的问题上，果然看到有什么祸根呢？

>I deny a providence, you say, and supreme governor of the world, who guides the course of events, and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment, and rewards the virtuous with honour and success, in all their undertakings. But surely, I deny not the course itself of events, which lies open to every one's inquiry and examination. I acknowledge, that, in the present order of things, virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice, and meets with a more favourable reception from the world. I am sensible, that, according to the past experience of mankind, friendship is the chief joy of human life, and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance between the virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sensible, that, to a well-disposed mind, every advantage is on the side of the former. And what can you say more, allowing all your suppositions and reasonings? You tell me, indeed, that this disposition of things proceeds from intelligence and design. But whatever it proceeds from, the disposition itself, on which depends our happiness or misery, and consequently our conduct and deportment in life is still the same. It is still open for me, as well as you, to regulate my behaviour, by my experience of past events. And if you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed, and a supreme distributive justice in the universe, I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good, and punishment of the bad, beyond the ordinary course of events; I here find the same fallacy, which I have before endeavoured to detect. You persist in imagining, that, if we grant that divine existence, for which you so earnestly contend, you may safely infer consequences from it, and add something to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from the attributes which you ascribe to your gods. You seem not to remember, that all your reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from effects to causes; and that every argument, deducted from causes to effects, must of necessity be a gross sophism; since it is impossible for you to know anything of the cause, but what you have antecedently, not inferred, but discovered to the full, in the effect.

诸位说，我不承认有一个神灵，不承认有一个崇高的管理世界者来指导各种事情的进行，并且在人类的事业中，来用恶名和失意惩罚恶人，用尊荣和成功奖励有德的人。不过我实在没有否认事情的进程，这种事情各个人在考察之后都是可以明白看到的。我承认，在现世的事物状态中，德性比罪恶可以使人较为心安，而且较受世人的欢迎。

我也明白，按照人类过去的经验说来，友谊就是人生的最大的愉快，而且中和就是平静和幸福的唯一源泉。我对于德性的生活和罪恶的生活，并不曾等量齐观，我分明知道，在一个没有偏见的人看来，各种利益都是在有德者一方面的。我们纵然承认了诸位的一切假设和推论，诸位还有进一层的说法么？诸位诚然告我说，事情的这种安排是由智慧和设计来的。但是不论这种安排是由何处来的，而我们的幸福或患难所依靠的这种安排本身仍是没有变的，我们的立身处世所依靠的这种安排仍是没有变的。我也仍和诸位一样，仍然可以借过去事情所给我的经验，来规范我的行为。诸位或者说，我们如果承认有一个神圣的上天，承认宇宙中有崇高的分配的正义，那我就可以在寻常的事物途径以外，来期望善人得到较特备的奖赏，恶人得到较特设的刑罚。但是我在这里仍然看到我先前努力所发现的那种错误。诸位总是爱这样想：我们如果承认诸位所坚持的那位神圣的存在，诸位就会借诸位所给与诸位的神灵的那些属性，确实地由那种存在来推出一些结论，并且在所经验到的自然秩序中加一些东西。

>But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners, who, instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation, so far reverse the whole course of nature, as to render this life merely a passage to something farther; a porch, which leads to a greater, and vastly different building; a prologue, which serves only to introduce the piece, and give it more grace and propriety? Whence, do you think, can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and imagination surely. For if they derived it from the present phenomena, it would never point to anything farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them. That the divinity may possibly be endowed with attributes, which we have never seen exerted; may be governed by principles of action, which we cannot discover to be satisfied: all this will freely be allowed. But still this is mere possibility and hypothesis. We never can have reason to infer any attributes, or any principles of action in him, but so far as we know them to have been exerted and satisfied.

诸位似乎忘记了，在这个题目方面，诸位的一切推论都只能由结果推到原因；诸位似乎忘记了，由原因推到结果的一切论证，都必然是一种荒唐的诡辩。因为诸位在原因方面所知道的，只限于诸位在结果中先前所发现的全部，而不是在其中所推测出的事情。

但是一个哲学家对这些虚妄的推理者当作何感想呢？这些推理者不以现在的事物状态是他们思维的唯一对象，他们竟然反转了自然的全部过程，使人生只成为将进于另一种状况的一种过渡阶段；他们认为人生只是一个门廊，它可以通到广阔而且别有天地的一所房屋；他们认为人生只是一个开场白，它的任务只是给一出戏剧作为引子，使它更加幽美，更见工夫。诸位试想，这类哲学家能在什么地方得来他们的神灵观念呢？那一定是从他们的幻想和想像来的。因为他们这种观念如果是由当前的现象得来的，那它万不会指向较进一层的东西，一定要恰恰同它们相适应。

我们自然完全承认，神灵可能具有我们不曾见其施展过的一些属性，他们或者被我们所不能见其实现的一些行动的原则所支配。不过这仍是一种可能性和一个假设。除了我们所见为已经施展、已经实现的一些属性而外，我们并没有任何别的理由，来推断他有任何别的属性或行动的原则。

在世界上果然有一些标记，使我们根据它们来推断有赏……罚的正义么？

>Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world? If you answer in the affirmative, I conclude, that, since justice here exerts itself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it, to the gods. If you hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by saying, that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts itself in part, but not in its full extent; I answer, that you have no reason to give it any particular extent, but only so far as you see it, at present, exert itself.

诸位如果给我一个肯定的答复，那我可以说，正……义既在这里施行出来，那它就已经实现了。诸位如果给我以否定的答复，那我也可以断言说，诸位也没有理由把我们所谓正义诿于神灵。如果诸位居于肯定和否定之间，而说，诸神的正义现在只施行了一半，却未全部施行出来；那我可以答复说，诸位没有别的理由可以在现在所见的已施行出来的正义而外，再把它扩大。

>Thus I bring the dispute, O Athenians, to a short issue with my antagonists. The course of nature lies open to my contemplation as well as to theirs. The experienced train of events is the great standard, by which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing else can be appealed to in the field, or in the senate. Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in the school, or in the closet. In vain would our limited understanding break through those boundaries, which are too narrow for our fond imagination. While we argue from the course of nature, and infer a particular intelligent cause, which first bestowed, and still preserves order in the universe, we embrace a principle, which is both uncertain and useless. It is uncertain; because the subject lies entirely beyond the reach of human experience. It is useless; because our knowledge of this cause being derived entirely from the course of nature, we can never, according to the rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause with any new inference, or making additions to the common and experienced course of nature, establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour.

雅典人啊，我对我的反对者就把我们的争论照下边这样简短的结束了。自然的途径是分明可以被我所思维的，也如它可以分明被别人所思维一样。

我们所经验到的一串事情，就是我们规范自己行为时的所依靠的大标准。在战场上或议会中我们并不能求助于别的东西。我们也不应当在学校中或密室中听别的讲说。我们的有限的理解虽然范围太狭，不足以供我们所钟爱的想像来驰骋，可是我们的理解虽想打破那些界限也是白费的。我们如果根据自然的途径来推论，并且推测有一个特殊的智慧的原因起初给了宇宙以秩序，后来又保持这种秩序，那我们就承受了一个既不确定而又无用的原则。

它所以是不确定的，乃是因为这个题目完全在于人类的经验以外。它所以是没有用的，乃是因为，我们这个原因的知识，既是完全由自然的途径来的，所以按照正确的推理规则说来，我们并不能由这个原因带一些新的推测返回来，我们也不能在普通所经验到的自然程序上加一些东西，来建立任何新的行为原则。

>I observe (said I, finding he had finished his harangue) that you neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old; and as you were pleased to make me stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my favour by embracing those principles, to which, you know, I have always expressed a particular attachment. But allowing you to make experience (as indeed I think you ought) the only standard of our judgement concerning this, and all other questions of fact; I doubt not but, from the very same experience, to which you appeal, it may be possible to refute this reasoning, which you have put into the mouth of Epicurus. If you saw, for instance, a half-finished building, surrounded with heaps of brick and stone and mortar, and all the instruments of masonry; could you not infer from the effect, that it was a work of design and contrivance? And could you not return again, from this inferred cause, to infer new additions to the effect, and conclude, that the building would soon be finished, and receive all the further improvements, which art could bestow upon it? If you saw upon the sea-shore the print of one human foot, you would conclude, that a man had passed that way, and that he had also left the traces of the other foot, though effaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the waters. Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with regard to the order of nature? Consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect building, from which you can infer a superior intelligence; and arguing from that superior intelligence, which can leave nothing imperfect; why may you not infer a more finished scheme or plan, which will receive its completion in some distant point of space or time? Are not these methods of reasoning exactly similar? And under what pretence can you embrace the one, while you reject the other?

我看他结束了他的雄辩以后，就说道，你倒是善于运用古代煽动者的诡计。你先让我来代表雅典人民，结果你又接受了你知道我所素爱的那些原则，因而徐徐地得到我的欢心。

但是我纵然承认你在这个事实的问题和别的事实的问题方面来用经验为我们判断的唯一标准；而我仍然相信，我可以根据你所求助的这种经验，来反驳你借伊壁鸠鲁的口说出的这种推论。

如果你看见一个半完成的建筑，周围堆着砖、石、灰泥以及泥水匠的一切工具，你不能由结果推测说，它是一个有计划的工作么？

你不能再返回来，由这个推测出的原因，在这个结果以外再来推测别的一些结果么？

你不能由此推言，这所建筑将要完成，而且将要得到艺术所能加于其上的一切涂饰么？如果你在海滨见了一个人的足印，你就应当断言，一个人曾经在那里经过，而且他也留下那另一只足的印纹——虽然那另一个印纹由沙翻和水冲所涂抹了。那么，在自然的秩序方面，你为什么不采用同样的推论方法呢？你如果把世界和现在的人生只看做是一个不完全的建筑（我们可以由此推测出一个崇高的智慧来）,而且根据不使一物有缺点的崇高神灵起首来辩论，那你为什么不能由此推测出一个较完美的设计，认为它在较远的时间或地点将要完成呢？这些推论方法不是恰乎相似的么？你根据什么借口来接受前一种推论方法，而排斥后一种呢？

>The infinite difference of the subjects, replied he, is a sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions. In works of human art and contrivance, it is allowable to advance from the effect to the cause, and returning back from the cause, to form new inferences concerning the effect, and examine the alterations, which it has probably undergone, or may still undergo. But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom we know by experience, whose motives and designs we are acquainted with, and whose projects and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence, according to the laws which nature has established for the government of such a creature. When, therefore, we find, that any work has proceeded from the skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise acquainted with the nature of the animal, we can draw a hundred inferences concerning what may be expected from him; and these inferences will all be founded in experience and observation. But did we know man only from the single work or production which we examine, it were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because our knowledge of all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in that case derived from the production, it is impossible they could point to anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference. The print of a foot in the sand can only prove, when considered alone, that there was some figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: but the print of a human foot proves likewise, from our other experience, that there was probably another foot, which also left its impression, though effaced by time or other accidents. Here we mount from the effect to the cause; and descending again from the cause, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning. We comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and observations, concerning the usual figure and members of that species of animal, without which this method of argument must be considered as fallacious and sophistical.

他又答复说，这两种题目间的无限差异，就是我的结论前后不同的充分基础。在人类艺术作品和设计作品方面，我们可以由结果进到原因，并且可以由原因返回来，关于结果来形成新的推测，并且来考察它所经过的那些变化，或将要经过的那些变化。不过这个推论方法的基础在那里呢？它的基础分明是这样的：就是，人是我们凭经验知道的一种实有，他的动机和设计也是我们所熟悉的，而且他的各种计划和倾向（按照自然管理这个实有时所立的法则）,是有一种联系和照应的。因此，我们如果看到有任何作品是由人的技艺和勤劳产生出来，而我们又因为熟习那种动物的天性，就可以对于他将来要做的事，求得百十种推测，而且这些推测都是建立在经验和观察上边的。但是我们如果只根据一种作品或产品来认识人，那我们便不能照这样来推论；因为在这种情形下，我们既然只凭那种产品才能知道我们所给它的那些性质，所以那些性质并不能指示出进一层的东西来，也不能成为任何新推测的基础。沙上的一个足印在单独被人考究时只能证明，有某种和它相适合的形相把它产生出来；但是人的一个足印却又可以凭我们的经验来证明，或者还有另一只足也留下了足印——虽然它被时间或别的情节所涂抹了。

在这里，我们由结果升到原因，又从那个原因降下来推测结果中的变化。

但是这并不是把一串简单的推论继续下去。

在这种情形下，我们包括了关于人这种动物的平常形相和肢体的百十种别的经验和观察，若非如此，则这种推论方法便应该被认为是谬误的或诡辩的。

>The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single being in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus, from whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As the universe shews wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and goodness. As it shews a particular degree of these perfections, we infer a particular degree of them, precisely adapted to the effect which we examine. But farther attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes, we can never be authorised to infer or suppose, by any rules of just reasoning. Now, without some such licence of supposition, it is impossible for us to argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good produced by this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness: a more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition to the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the Author of nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any reason or argument, can never be admitted but as mere conjecture and hypothesis30.

在这种情形下，我们包括了关于人这种动物的平常形相和肢体的百十种别的经验和观察，若非如此，则这种推论方法便应该被认为是谬误的或诡辩的。

我们在根据自然的作品而行推论时，则情形便和上述的不一样。那个神明只借他的产品为我们所如，而且他是宇宙中唯一的实有，并不隶属于任何一种、任何一类，使我们可以由所经验到的那些种类的属性或性质，借比符作用来推测他有任何别的性质或属性。

宇宙既然表示出智慧和善意来，所以我们也只可以推测有智慧和善意。宇宙既然把这些完美属性只表示出某种程度来，所以我们也只可以推测某种程度的属性，我们必须使所推测出的品德恰好同我们所考察出的结果相当。但照任何正确的推理规则说来，我们没有权利来推测或来假设别的属性，或同一属性的较大的程度。我们如没有进行这类假设的许可，那我们在直接观察到的现象以外，再不能由原因来进行辩论或推测结果中有任何变化。这个神明如果产生了更大的善事，那就证明他有更大的善意；他如果能够更公平地来施行奖赏和刑罚，那就证明他更顾虑正义和公道。在自然的作品上，我们如果凭想像给它们再加添一些东西，那我们同时就把自然的创造者的属性也加添了。

因此，这些想像的增加既然完全不被任何理由或论证所证实，那我们就不能承认它们，只能认它们是猜测和假设①。

①概括地说来，我们似乎可以立一个公理说，任何一个原因如果只是借它的特殊的结果被人所认识，那我们万不能由那个原因来推测任何新的结果。因为能在前述结果以外来产生新结果的那些性质，比单产生前述结果（我们只假设由此结果得知那个原因）的那些性质，不是不一样，就是较高等，否则就是作用较广。因此，我们就没有任何理由来假设这些性质的存在。人们或者说，新的结果所以能产生出来，只是由于我们由起初结果所推测出的那种力量，继续作用着。

不过这也并不能把困难免除了。因为我们纵然承认这一层（这一层是不常被人假设的）,但是我们所假设的异时异地中这种相似力量（因为它是不能绝对相同的）的继续施展，乃是一种很任意的假设，它在我们所见的结果中并没有任何踪迹——可是我们对原因所有的一切知识原来还都是由这个结果来的。

我们如果使推测出…的原因精确地和已知的结果成比例（这实在是应该的）,那它并没有别的性质，使我们根据它们来推测出别的新结果来……在这个题目方面，我们所以有错误，所以任意纵情有所猜想，其最大的原因，就在于我们默然使自己处于最高神明的地位，并且断言，他在每一种情形下，也和我们处于他那地位时一样，也要遵守我们所认为合理的、可行的那些行为规则。不过自然的寻常途径已经使我们相信，差不多样样事情所依以进行的原则和公理，都和我们的不一样，而且除此以外，我们还分明看到，要根据人类的意向和计划来推论异于人类万分、高于人类万分的神明的意向和设计，那是最违反一切比论的规则的。在人性中我们经验到各种设计和心向有一种照应，所以我们如果在某种事情方面发现了某人的一种意向，那我们往往可以合理地根据经验来推测另一种意向，并且关于他的过去的或将来的行为求得一长串结论。但是在神明方面，这种推论方法是永远不能适用的。因为这个神明是那样辽远、那样不可思议的，他和宇宙中任何别的事物相似的程度，比太阳和蜡烛的相似程度还要小得多；他只是借一种微弱的踪迹或外形来表示出自己来，超过这个限度，我们就没有什么根据可以给他以任何属性或美德。我们所想像的卓越的美德或者实际只是一种缺陷。纵然它是无以复加的一种美德，而我们在崇高的神明似乎未曾把这种”美德“充分施展在他的作品内时，遽然认他有那种美德，那也只近于谄媚和阿谀，而不近于正确的推论和健全的哲学。因此，世界上一切哲学和一切宗教（它只是哲学的一种）,都不能使我们超出自然的寻常的途径，也不能在我们反省日常生活时所得的行为规范以外，再供给一些别的规范。我们并不能根据宗教的假设来推测任何新事实，也不能预见或预言任何事情，而且我们除了借实践和观察所知道的那些赏罚而外，我们也不能再希望别的奖赏，畏惧别的惩罚。所以我替伊壁鸠鲁所提出的答辩仍然似乎是很牢固，很满意的；社会上的政治利益同形上学及宗教方面的理论争辩，并没有什么关联。

我答复说，还有一种情节，你似乎把它忽略过了。我虽然可以承认你的前提，却不能不否认你的结论。

你断言说，宗教的教条和推论在人生上”不能“有任何影响，因为它们”不应该“发生影响。但是你却不想，人们并不照你这样来推…论，他们由神圣存在的信仰推得许多结论，并且假设，除了我们在自然途径中所见的赏罚以外，神明还另要加刑于恶，加赏于善。他们这种推论正确与否，那并没有关系。但这种推论在他们生活和行为上的影响，必然是一样的——不论它错误与否。有人如果想把他们这种谬见解除了，而那些人或者算是高明的推理家，但是我却不能承认他们是良好的公民和政治家；因为他们使人们摆脱掉了感情嗜欲所应受的羁绊，而且在某一方面使人们更容易、更安全地干违犯社会的法律。

总而言之，我对于你那个拥护自由的概括结论，也许可以很赞同，不过我所以这样来赞同你，所凭的前提和你建立这个结论时所凭的并不一样。我想，国家应该容忍各种哲学原则，而且我也不曾见过，有任何政府曾经因为这样放纵的原故，致其政治的利益有所损失。哲学家一般并没有大的热忱；他们的学说也不能十分迷惑一般人民。我们如果要限制他们的推论，那一定会危及于科学，甚或危及于国家，因为这样慢慢就可以在一般人所十分关心的那些方面准备好杀戮和压迫的道路。

我就继续说，关于你的主要论题，我似乎看见有一种困难。不过我现在只把这种困难提出来，并不深究它，免得陷于太细微精致的推论中。一句话说，就是我很怀疑，一个原因是否只可以借它的结果被我们所知（如你一向所假设的）,一个原因是否能以十分单独，十分特殊，以至于和我们所观察到的任何别的原因或物象都不平行，都不相似。只有在我们见了两种物象恒常会合在一块时，我们才能由这一个推测那一个；假如所呈现出的结果是完全单独的，并不能归在任何已知的种类中，那我就完全看不到，我们关于它的原因能有任何猜想或推测。在这类推测方面，我们所能合理地依从的惟一指导如果只有经验、观察和类比，则结果和原因一定得同我们所知道并且看见在许多例证中都会合在一块的别的结果和原因相似才行。我让你自己借反省来追求这个原则的结果好了。现在我只可以说，伊壁鸠鲁的反对者既然假设宇宙（一个十分单独而无偶的结果）可以证明神明的存在（同样单独而无偶的一个原因）,所以在这个假设之下看来，你的推论至少是值得注意的。我承认这里有一个难题，就是，我们如何能由那个原因返回来推到结果，我们如何能由原因的观念来推测结果中有任何变化或增加。

The great source of our mistake in this subject, and of the unbounded licence of conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly consider ourselves, as in the place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct, which we ourselves, in his situation, would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But, besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us, that almost everything is regulated by principles and maxims very different from ours; besides this, I say, it must evidently appear contrary to all rules of analogy to reason, from the intentions and projects of men, to those of a Being so different, and so much superior. In human nature, there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations; so that when, from any fact, we have discovered one intention of any man, it may often be reasonable, from experience, to infer another, and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being, so remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection. What we imagine to be a superior perfection, may really be a defect. Or were it ever so much a perfection, the ascribing of it to the Supreme Being, where it appears not to have been really exerted, to the full, in his works, savours more of flattery and panegyric, than of just reasoning and sound philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, in the world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us measures of conduct and behaviour different from those which are furnished by reflections on common life. No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis; no event foreseen or foretold; no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is already known by practice and observation. So that my apology for Epicurus will still appear solid and satisfactory; nor have the political interests of society any connexion with the philosophical disputes concerning metaphysics and religion.

114.There is still one circumstance, replied I, which you seem to have overlooked. Though I should allow your premises, I must deny your conclusion. You conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings can have no influence on life, because they ought to have no influence; never considering, that men reason not in the same manner you do, but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine Existence, and suppose that the Deity will inflict punishments on vice, and bestow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature. Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not, is no matter. Its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And, those, who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may, for aught I know, be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians; since they free men from one restraint upon their passions, and make the infringement of the laws of society, in one respect, more easy and secure.

After all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general conclusion in favour of liberty, though upon different premises from those, on which you endeavour to found it. I think, that the state ought to tolerate every principle of philosophy; nor is there an instance, that any government has suffered in its political interests by such indulgence. There is no enthusiasm among philosophers; their doctrines are not very alluring to the people; and no restraint can be put upon their reasonings, but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences, and even to the state, by paving the way for persecution and oppression in points, where the generality of mankind are more deeply interested and concerned.

115.But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your main topic, a difficulty, which I shall just propose to you without insisting on it; lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its effect (as you have all along supposed) or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object, that has ever fallen under our observation. It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be comprehended under any known species, I do not see, that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes, which we know, and which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle. I shall just observe, that, as the antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled; your reasonings, upon that supposition, seem, at least, to merit our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how we can ever return from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our ideas of the former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any addition to it.
