 ## Preparation
 ### Book Summary
 The Second Treatise of Government places sovereignty[至高无上的权利] into the hands of the people. Locke's fundamental argument is that people are equal and invested with natural rights in a state of nature in which they live free from outside rule. In the state of nature, natural law governs behavior, and each person has license to execute that law against someone who wrongs them by infringing[违背] on their rights. People take what they need from the earth, but hoard[收集] just enough to cover their needs. Eventually, people begin to trade their excess goods with each other, until they develop a common currency for barter[物物交换], or money. Money eliminates limits on the amount of property they can obtain (unlike food, money does not spoil), and they begin to gather estates[地产] around themselves and their families.

People then exchange some of their natural rights to enter into society with other people, and be protected by common laws and a common executive power to enforce the laws. People need executive power to protect their property and defend their liberty. The civil state is beholden to the people, and has power over the people only insofar as it exists to protect and preserve their welfare. Locke describes a state with a separate judicial, legislative, and executive branch--the legislative branch being the most important of the three, since it determines the laws that govern civil society.

People have the right to dissolve their government, if that government ceases to work solely in their best interest. The government has no sovereignty of its own--it exists to serve the people.

To sum up, Locke's model consists of a civil state, built upon the natural rights common to a people who need and welcome an executive power to protect their property and liberties; the government exists for the people's benefit and can be replaced or overthrown if it ceases to function toward that primary end.

### Related to the prompt
In John Locke's justification of political authority, he makes both empirical and religious assumptions. Empirical assumptions refer to observations and facts that are based on experience or evidence, while religious assumptions refer to beliefs that are based on faith or divine revelation.

The empirical assumptions in Locke's justification of political authority include the idea that individuals have natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, and that government exists to protect these rights. He also assumes that individuals have the capacity for reason and that they are capable of making decisions about how they are governed.

Locke's religious assumptions include the idea that God has given individuals the right to govern themselves and that government should be based on natural law, which is derived from divine revelation. He also assumes that God has created humans with the capacity for reason and that individuals have a duty to obey God's laws.

In terms of which assumptions are crucial, both the empirical and religious assumptions play a significant role in Locke's justification of political authority. The empirical assumptions provide the foundation for his ideas about the role of government in protecting individual rights, while the religious assumptions provide the basis for his ideas about the morality and legitimacy of government. Ultimately, both sets of assumptions are necessary for his overall argument about political authority.

John Locke's political philosophy is grounded in religious assumptions that are rooted in Christianity. Some of the key religious assumptions in his work include:

- The belief in a higher power: In his work, Locke refers to a "Creator" who is the source of all things and who has established the laws of nature.

- The idea that morality and justice are rooted in divine law: Locke believed that the laws of nature are derived from divine law and that individuals have a duty to follow them. He also believed that the purpose of government is to enforce these laws and to protect the rights of individuals.

- The belief in natural rights: Locke believed that individuals have natural rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, that are granted by God and protected by the laws of nature.

### Structure
The structure of the essay could be as follows:

Introduction: Provide a brief overview of John Locke's political philosophy, highlighting his ideas on the justification of political authority and the role of empirical and religious assumptions in his work.

Overview of Empirical Assumption: Discuss Locke's views on the importance of experience, observation, and evidence in shaping human knowledge. Detail the central features of his empirical assumption, including the idea that people have natural rights and that political authority arises from a social contract.

Overview of Religious Assumption: Discuss Locke's views on the role of religion in shaping political authority. Detail the central features of his religious assumption, including the idea that the law of nature is a product of divine revelation and that political authority is subject to divine judgment.

Empirical Assumption and Natural Rights: Argue that the empirical assumption is central to Locke's justification of political authority because it underlies his ideas on natural rights. Discuss the ways in which experience, observation, and evidence are used to support the idea that all people have the right to life, liberty, and property.

Religious Assumption and Divine Revelation: Argue that the religious assumption is less important than the empirical one in the justification of political authority because it relies on the idea of divine revelation. Discuss the ways in which this idea can be challenged, and how this challenges the validity of political authority based on religious assumptions.

Empirical Assumption and Social Contract: Argue that the empirical assumption is more important than the religious one in the justification of political authority because it provides a basis for the social contract. Discuss the ways in which the social contract is based on a mutual agreement between the people and the government, and how this agreement is shaped by the empirical assumption.

Conclusion: Sum up the main arguments of the essay and provide a final conclusion on why the empirical assumption is more important than the religious one in the justification of political authority.

### Quotes: Religion
- [6] But though this be a state of liberty, yet it is not a state of licence: though man in that state have an uncontroulable liberty to dispose of his person or possessions, yet he has not liberty to destroy himself, or so much as any creature in his possession, but where some nobler use than its bare preservation calls for it. **The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions**: for men being all the workmanship of one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into the world by his order, and about his business; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties, sharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one another's uses, as the inferior ranks of creatures are for our's. Every one, as he is bound to preserve himself, and not to quit his station wilfully, so by the like reason, when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as much as he can, to preserve the rest of mankind, and may not, unless it be to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what tends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another.
  > 虽然这是自由的状态，却不是放任的状态。在这状态中，虽然人具有处理他的人身或财产的无限自由，但是他并没有毁灭自身或他所占有的任何生物的自由，除非有一种比单纯地保存它来得更高贵的用处要求将它毁灭。自然状态有一种为人人所应遵守的自然法对它起着支配作用；而理性，也就是自然法，教导着有意遵从理性的全人类：人们既然都是平等和独立的，任何人就不得侵害他人的生命、健康、自由或财产。因为既然人们都是全能和无限智慧的创世主的创造物，既然都是唯一的最高主宰的仆人，奉他的命令来到这个世界，从事于他的事务，他们就是他的财产，是他的创造物，他要他们存在多久就存在多久，而不由他们彼此之间作主；我们既赋有同样的能力，在同一自然社会内共享一切，就不能设想我们之间有任何从属关系，可使我们有权彼此毁灭，好像我们生来是为彼此利用的，如同低等动物生来是供我们利用一样。正因为每一个人必须保存自己，不能擅自改变他的地位，所以基于同样理由，当他保存自身不成问题时，他就应该尽其所能保存其余的人类，而除非为了惩罚一个罪犯，不应该夺去或损害另一个人的生命以及一切有助于保存另一个人的生命、自由、健康、肢体或物品的事物。

- [22] THE natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule.
    > 人的自然自由，就是不受人间任何上级权力的约束，不处在人们的意志或立法权之下，只以自然法作为他的准绳。
