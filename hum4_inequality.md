It is of man that I have to speak, and the question I am examining indicates to me that I am going to be speaking to men, for such questions are not proposed by those who are afraid to honor the truth. I will therefore confidently defend the cause of humanity before the wise men who invite me to do so, and I will not be displeased with myself if I make myself worthy of my subject and my judges.

>我要论述的是人，而我所研究的问题启示我应当向人们来论述，我想，害怕发扬真理的人，是不会提出这类问题的。所以，我不揣冒昧，在给我以鼓舞的贤达者们面前，为人类辩护。如果我不辜负这个论题和各位评判员的话，我将会感到满意。

I conceive of two kinds of inequality in the human species: one that I call natural or physical, because it is established by nature and consists in the difference of age, health, bodily strength, and qualities of mind or soul. The other may be called moral  or political inequality, because it depends on a kind of convention and is established, or at least authorized, by the consent of men. This latter type of inequality consists in the different privileges enjoyed by some at the expense of others, such as being richer, more honored, more powerful than they, or even causing themselves to be obeyed by them. 

>我认为在人类中有两种不平等：一种，我把它叫作自然的或生理上的不平等，因为它是基于自然，由年龄、健康、体力以及智慧或心灵的性质的不同而产生的；另一种可以称为精神上的或政治上的不平等，因为它是起因于一种协议，由于人们的同意而设定的，或者至少是它的存在为大家所认可的。第二种不平等包括某一些人由于损害别人而得以享受的各种特权，譬如：比别人更富足、更光荣、更有权势，或者甚至叫别人服从他们。

There is no point in asking what the source of natural inequality is, because the answer would be found enunciated in the simple definition of the word. There is still less of a point in asking whether there would not be some essential connection between the two inequalities, for that would amount to asking whether those who command are necessarily better than those who obey, and whether strength of body or mind, wisdom or virtue, are always found in the same individuals in proportion to power or wealth. Perhaps this is a good question for slaves to discuss within earshot of their masters, but it is not suitable for reasonable and free men who seek the truth. 

>我们不必问什么是自然的不平等的根源，因为在这几个字的字义里面，已包含了这一问题的答案。我们更不必追问在这两种不平等之间，有没有实质上的联系。因为换句话说，这就等于问所有发号施令的人是否一定优于服从命令的人，在同样的人们之中，他们的体力或智力，才能或品德是否总和他们的权势或财富相称。这样的问题，向奴隶们提出并让他们的主人听他们讨论，也许是好的，但不适于提供有理性的、自由的、追求真理的人去研究。

Precisely what, then, is the subject of this discourse? To mark, in the development of things, the moment when, right taking the place of violence, nature was subjected to the law. To explain the sequence of wonders by which the strong could resolve to serve the weak, and the people to buy imaginary repose at the price of real felicity. The philosophers who have examined the foundations of society have all felt the necessity of returning to the state of nature, but none of them has reached it. Some have not hesitated to ascribe to man in that state the notion of just and unjust, without bothering to show that he had to have that notion, or even that it was useful to him. Others have spoken of the natural right that everyone has to preserve what belongs to him, without explaining what they mean by “belonging.”  Others started

out by giving authority to the stronger over the weaker, and immediately brought about government, without giving any thought to the time that had to pass before the meaning of the words “authority” and “government” could exist among men. Finally, all of them, speaking continually of need, avarice, oppression, desires, and pride, have transferred to the state of nature the ideas they themselves acquired in society. They spoke about savage man, and it was civilized man they depicted. It did not even occur to most of our philosophers to doubt that the state of nature had existed, even though it is evident from reading the Holy Scriptures that the first man, having received enlightenment and precepts immediately from God, was not himself in that state; and if we give the writings of Moses the credence that every Christian owes them, we must deny that, even before the flood, men were ever in the pure state of nature, unless they had fallen back into it because of some extraordinary event: a paradox that is quite awkward to defend and utterly impossible to prove.

>那么这篇论文里所要论述的究竟是什么呢？是要指出在事物的演进中，在什么样的一个时机权利代替了暴力，自然服从了法律；是要说明到底由于什么样的一系列的奇迹，才使强者能够决意为弱者服务，人民能够决意牺牲实际幸福，来换取一种空想的安宁。研究过社会基础的哲学家们，都认为有追溯到自然状态的必要，但是没有一个人曾经追溯到这种状态。有些人毫不犹豫地设想，在自然状态中的人，已有正义和非正义的观念，但他们却没有指出在自然状态中的人何以会有这种观念，甚至也没有说明这种观念对他有什么用处。另外有一些人谈到自然权利，即每个人所具有的保存属于自己的东西的权利，但却没有阐明他们对于属于一词的理解。再有一些人首先赋予强者以统治弱者的权力，因而就认为政府是由此产生的，但他们根本没有想到在人类脑筋里能够存在权力和政府等名词的意义以前，需要经过多么长的一段时间。总之，所有这些人不断地在请人类的需要、贪婪、压迫、欲望和骄傲的时候，其实是把从社会里得来的一些观念，搬到自然状态上去了；他们论述的是野蛮人，而描绘的却是文明人。甚至在现代多数学者的头脑中，对自然状态的存在从未发生过疑问，可是一读圣经，便明了第一个人已经直接从上帝那里接受了智慧和训诫，他本身就不曾处于自然状态；而且如果我们象每个信奉基督教的哲学家那样相信摩西著述的话，便必须承认，人们即在洪水之前，也不曾处于纯粹的自然状态，除非他们因某种非常事故重新堕入其中则又当别论。否认这种说法的奇说异论是很难维护并且也是完全不能证实的。

Let us therefore begin by putting aside all the facts, for they have no bearing on the question. The investigations that may be undertaken concerning this subject should not be taken for historical truths, but only for hypothetical and conditional reasonings, better suited to shedding light on the nature of things than on pointing out their true origin, like those our physicists make every day with regard to the formation of the world. Religion commands us to believe that since God himself drew men out of the state of nature, they are unequal because he wanted them to be so; but it does not forbid us to form conjectures, drawn solely from the nature of man and the beings that surround him, concerning what the human race could have become, if it had been left to itself. That is what I am asked, and what I propose to examine in this discourse. Since my subject concerns man in general, I will attempt to speak in terms that suit all nations, or rather, forgetting times and places in order to think only of the men to whom I am speaking, I will imagine I am in the Lyceum in Athens, reciting the lessons of my masters, having men like Plato and Xenocrates for my judges, and the human race for my audience.

> 所以我们首先要把一切事实撇开，因为这些事实是与我所研究的问题毫不相干的。不应当把我们在这个主题上所能着手进行的一些研究认为是历史真象，而只应认为是一些假定的和有条件的推理。这些推理与其说是适于说明事物的真实来源，不如说是适于阐明事物的性质，正好象我们的物理学家，每天对宇宙形成所作的那些推理一样。宗教让我们相信：上帝自己刚把人类创造出来，就立刻使人摆脱了自然状态，他们是不平等的，因为上帝愿意他们那样。但是宗教并未禁止我们只根据人和他周围存在物的性质，来猜测一下，倘若让人类自然发展的话，究竟会变成什么样子。这就是人们所要求于我的；也就是我自己想要在这篇论文里加以研究的。由于我的主题涉及整个人类，所以我尽量采用一种适宜于各国人的语言；或者不如说撇开时间和地点，只想着在听我讲话的那些人，并假定我是在古代雅典的学园里，背诵老师留给的课业，评判员是柏拉图和克塞诺克拉特那样的人，听众就是整个的人类。

 O man, whatever country you may be from, whatever your opinions may be, listen: here is your history, as I have thought to read it, not in the books of your fellowmen, who are liars, but in nature, which never lies. Everything that comes from nature will be true; there will be nothing false except what I have unintentionally added. The times about which I am going to speak are quite remote: how much you have changed from what you were! It is, as it were, the life of your species that I am about to describe to you according to the qualities you have received, which your education and your habits have

been able to corrupt but have been unable to destroy. There is, I feel, an age at which an individual man would want to stop. You will seek the age at which you would want your species to have stopped. Dissatisfied with your present state for reasons that portend even greater grounds for dissatisfaction for your unhappy posterity, perhaps you would like to be able to go backward in time. This thought should be a hymn in praise of your first ancestors, a critique of your contemporaries, and should strike dread into those who have the unhappiness of living after you. 

>啊！人啊，不论你是什么地方人，不论你的意见如何，请听吧！这是你的历史，我自信我曾经读过它；但不是在你的那些喜欢撒谎的同类所写的书籍里读的，而是在永不撒谎的大自然里读的②。出于自然的一切都是真的；只有我于无意中掺入的我自己的东西，可能是假的。我所要谈的时代已经很遥远了，你已经改变了原来的状态，而且改变得多么大呀！我所要给你描述的，可以说是你这一种类的生活。这种描写是根据你所禀赋的性质，而这种性质可能已为你所受的教育和所沾染的习惯所败坏，不过尚未完全毁掉而已。我觉得有这样一个时代，个人会愿意停留在那里：你将会追寻你愿意整个人类在那里停留的那个时代。你不满意你的现状，由于种种原因预示着你的不幸的后裔将会感到更大的不满，所以你或许愿意能够倒退。这种感情无异于对你的始祖的颂扬；对你的同时代人的批评；而且也会使不幸生在你以后的人感到震惊。

## PART ONE

However important it may be, in order to render sound judgments regarding the natural state of man, to consider him from his origin and to examine him, so to speak, in the first embryo of the species, I will not follow his nature through its successive developments. I will not stop to investigate in the animal kingdom what he might have been at the beginning so as eventually to become what he is. I will not examine whether, as Aristotle thinks, man’s elongated nails were not at first hooked claws, whether man was not furry like a bear, and whether, if man walked on all fours, iii his gaze, directed toward the ground and limited to a horizon of a few steps, did not provide an indication of both the character and the limits of his ideas. On this subject I could form only vague and almost imaginary conjectures. Comparative anatomy has as yet made too little progress; the observations of naturalists are as yet too uncertain for one to be able to establish the basis of solid reasoning on such foundations. Thus, without having recourse to the supernatural knowledge we have on this point, and without taking note of the changes that must have occurred in the internal as well as the external conformation of man, as he applied his limbs to new purposes and nourished himself on new foods, I will suppose him to have been formed from all time as I see him today: walking on two feet, using his hands as we use ours, directing his gaze over all of nature, and measuring with his eyes the vast expanse of the heavens. 

>为了正确地判断人的自然状态，必须从人的起源来观察人类，也可以说必须从人的最初胚胎的时期来研究人类。这尽管是一种很重要的方法，但我并不想通过人的连续不断的发展来探讨人的构造。因此，我不准备探讨在动物的体系中人是怎样从他最初的样子，终于变成了现在的样子。我不想去研究，是否真地象亚里士多德所想的，今天人的长指甲最初不过是弯曲着的爪子；是否在原始状态中，人也象熊一样，周身是毛；以及是否最初的人由于用四足行走，他的视线总注向地面，只能望到几步远，因而就决定了他的观念的性质，同时也决定了他的观念的范围。我在这些问题上，只能作一些几乎近于想象的笼统的猜测。比较解剖学现时还没有多大的进步，博物学家的观察也还不十分确切，因而不能以此为依据来建立一个健全的理论基础。这样，如果我不借助于有关这方面的超自然的知识，也不去注意人类因为将四肢用于新的用途和食用新的食物而在内部和外部构造上必然会发生的那些变化，我将要推定人自原始时期以来，他的构造就和我今天所见的一样：都用二足行走，都象我们一样使用双手作事，目光射向整个大自然，并用眼睛观测广大无边的天空。

When I strip that being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural gifts he could have received, and of all the artificial faculties he could have acquired only through a lengthy process; when I consider him, in a word, as he must have left the hands of nature, I see an animal less strong than some, less agile than others, but all in all, the most advantageously organized of all. I see him satisfying his hunger under an oak tree, quenching his thirst at the first stream, finding his bed at the foot of the same tree that supplied his meal; and thus all his needs are satisfied. 
>如果把这样构成的一种生物，剥去了他所能禀受的一切超自然的天赋，剥去了他仅因长期进步才能获得的一切人为的能力，也就是说，如果只观察他刚从自然中生长出来时的样子，那末，我便可以看到人这种动物，并不如某些动物强壮，也不如另一些动物敏捷，但总起来说，他的构造却比一切动物都要完善。我看到他在橡树下饱餐，在随便遇到的一条河沟里饮水，在供给他食物的树下找到睡觉的地方，于是他的需要便完全满足了。

When the earth is left to its natural fertility and covered with immense forests that were never mutilated by the axe, it offers storehouses and shelters at every step to animals of every species. Men, dispersed among the animals, observe and imitate their skills, and thereby raise themselves to the level of

### 48
animal instinct, with the advantage that, whereas each species has only its own instincts, man, who may perhaps have none that belongs to him, appropriates all of them to himself, feeds himself equally well on most of the various foods that the other animals divide among themselves, and consequently finds his sustenance more easily than any of the rest can. 

>如果天然肥沃的大地照原始状态那样存在着，复盖着大地的无边森林不曾受到任何刀斧的砍伐，那么，这样的大地到处都会供给各种动物以食物仓库和避难所。分散于各种动物之中的人们，观察了而且模拟了它们的技巧，因而逐渐具有了禽兽的本能。此外，人还有这样一个优点：各种禽兽只有它自己所固有的本能，人本身也许没有任何一种固有的本能，但却能逐渐取得各种禽兽的本能，同样地，其他动物分别享受的种种食料大部分也可以作为人的食物，因此人比其他任何一种动物都更容易觅取食物。

Accustomed from childhood to inclement weather and the rigors of the seasons, acclimated to fatigue, and forced, naked and without arms, to defend their lives and their prey against other ferocious beasts, or to escape them by taking flight, men develop a robust and nearly unalterable temperament. Children enter the world with the excellent constitution of their parents and strengthen it with the same exercises that produced it, thus acquiring all the vigor that the human race is capable of having. Nature treats them precisely the way the law of Sparta treated the children of its citizens: it renders strong and robust those who are well constituted and makes all the rest perish, thereby differing from our present-day societies, where the state, by making children burdensome to their parents, kills them indiscriminately before their birth.[27]
>人们因为从幼年时期就习惯于气候的不正常以及季节的酷暑和严寒，因为在日常生活的锻炼中获得了耐劳的习惯，同时为了保卫自己的生命和猎获物又不得不裸体地、赤手空拳地去对抗其他猛兽，或者为了躲避猛兽而不得不迅速逃跑，所以，人便养成了一种强壮的、几乎不会变坏的体质。儿童一出世就承继了父母的优良体质，并且用养成这种体质的同样锻炼来加强自己的体质，这样便获得了人类可能获得的全部精力。自然对待他们，恰如斯巴达的法律对待公民的儿童一样，它使那些生来体格健全的幼儿变成强壮有力的人，而使其余的夭亡①。这是和我们的社会不同的，在我们的社会里，国家使幼儿成为父母的负担，因而在幼儿未出生以前，就不分优劣地把他们置之于死地了。

Since the savage man’s body is the only instrument he knows, he employs it for a variety of purposes that, for lack of practice, ours are incapable of serving. And our skills deprive us of the force and agility that necessity obliges him to acquire. If he had an axe, would his wrists break such strong branches? If he had had a sling, would he throw a stone with so much force? If he had a ladder, would he climb a tree so nimbly? If he had a horse, would he run so fast? Give a civilized man time to gather all his machines around him, and undoubtedly he will easily overcome a savage man. But if you want to see an even more unequal fight, put them against each other naked and disarmed, and you will soon realize the advantage of constantly having all of one’s forces at one’s disposal, of always being ready for any event, and of always carrying one’s entire self, as it were, with one.
>野蛮人的身体，是他自己所认识的唯一工具，他把身体用于各种不同的用途，我们由于缺乏锻炼，已不能象他那样使用自己的身体了。因为我们有技巧，所以我们已经没有野蛮人因实际需要而养成的那种体力和敏捷。假如已经有了斧头，他还能用手腕去折断那么粗大的树枝吗？假如已经有了投石器，他还能那么有力地用手投掷石头吗？假如已经有了梯子，他还能那么轻捷地攀援树木吗？假如已经有了马，他还能跑得那么快吗？如果一个文明人有充分时间把这一切工具收集在自己身旁，毫无疑问，他会很容易地战胜野蛮人。但是，如果你有心观看一个更不势均力敌的战斗，使这两种人赤身露体赤手空拳地较量一番，你马上就会承认：具有随时可以使用的一切力量的、永远在准备着应付任何事故的、也可以说本身自始至终就具备了一切的那一个人，占着何等的优势。

Hobbes maintains that man is naturally intrepid and seeks only to attack and fight. On the other hand, an illustrious philosopher thinks, and Cumberland and Pufendorf also affirm, that nothing is as timid as man in the state of nature, and that he is always trembling and ready to take flight at the slightest sound he hears or at the slightest movement he perceives.[28] That may be the case with regard to objects with which he is not acquainted. And I do not doubt that he is frightened by all the new sights that present themselves to him every time he can neither discern the physical good and evil he may expect from them nor compare his forces with the dangers he

>28 [The illustrious philosopher is Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, bk. 1, ch. 2. Richard Cumberland is the author of a refutation of Hobbes, On the Laws of Nature (1672). Samuel Pufendorf (1632– 1694) was widely regarded as the leading authority on the law of nature.]

### 49
must run: rare circumstances in the state of nature, where everything takes place in such a uniform manner and where the face of the earth is not subject to those sudden and continual changes caused by the passions and inconstancy of peoples living together. But a savage man lives dispersed among the animals and, finding himself early on in a position to measure himself against them, he soon makes the comparison; and, aware that he surpasses them in skillfulness more than they surpass him in strength, he learns not to fear them anymore. Pit a bear or a wolf against a savage who is robust, agile, and courageous, as they all are, armed with stones and a hefty cudgel, and you will see that the danger will be at least equal on both sides, and that after several such experiences, ferocious beasts, which do not like to attack one another, will be quite reluctant to attack a man, having found him to be as ferocious as themselves. With regard to animals that actually have more strength than man has skillfulness, he is in the same position as other weaker species, which nevertheless subsist. Man has the advantage that, since he is no less adept than they at running and at finding almost certain refuge in trees, he always has the alternative of accepting or leaving the encounter and the choice of taking flight or entering into combat. Moreover, it appears that no animal naturally attacks man, except in the case of self-defense or extreme hunger, or shows evidence of those violent antipathies toward him that seem to indicate that one species is destined by nature to serve as food for another.
>霍布斯认为人类天生是大胆的，只想进行攻击和战斗。另一位著名的哲学家的想法则恰恰相反，这位哲学家认为（康贝尔兰德和普芬道夫也同样地断言说）没有比在自然状态中的人更胆小的了，他一听到轻微声音或望到微小动作就吓得发抖并准备逃跑。这种情形对于他所不认识的事物来说，可能是真实的，我也决不怀疑，当任何一种新奇景象出现在他眼前，而他不能分辨这种景象到底对他本身有益或有害，也不能把他自己的力量和他要冒的危险加以比较时，他会被吓倒的。但这种情形在自然状态中，毕竟是很少见的。在自然状态中，一切事物都按照单调的方式进行着，而且大地上还轻易不会发生由于聚居人民的情欲和任意行动而引起的那种突然的、继续不断的变化。可是，分散地生活在野兽中间的野蛮人，很早就和野兽进行过搏斗。因此，他很快就同野兽作了比较，当他逐渐感觉到他在机巧方面胜过野兽的程度，远远超过野兽在力量方面胜过他的时候，他就知道不必再惧怕野兽了。如果让一只熊或一只狼去和一个粗壮、敏捷、勇敢（所有的野蛮人都是这样）而用石头和棍子武装起来的野蛮人搏斗，你将会看出，至少是双方都有生命的危险，而且经过许多次这样的试验之后，素来不爱相互攻击的野兽，也不太愿意对人进行攻击，因为它们终于会发现人和它们是同样的凶猛。至于有些动物，它们在力量方面胜过人的程度，确实超过人在机巧方面胜过它们的程度；那么，人在它们面前，就同其他比较弱小的动物处于相似的情况，而那些比较弱小的动物并未因此不能继续生存下去。而且人还有一个优点，即：奔跑起来人和其他动物同样敏捷，并且可以在树上找到一个相当安全的避难所，当他和野兽相遭遇的时候，可以到处利用或随时离开这种避难所，因而可以自由选择逃避或搏斗。再说，无论哪一种动物，除非在自卫或特别饥饿的情形下，好象都不是天然就好和人搏斗的，也决不会对人表示那样强烈的反感，这种反感好象是在宣示某一种类已被自然注定要作另一种类的食物似的。

No doubt these are the reasons why Negroes and savages bother themselves so little about the ferocious beasts they may encounter in the woods. In this respect, the Caribs of Venezuela, among others, live in the most profound security and without the slightest inconvenience. Although they are practically naked, says Francisco Coreal, they boldly expose themselves in the forest, armed only with bow and arrow, but no one has ever heard of one of them being devoured by animals.[29]
>毫无疑问，这就是为什么黑人和野蛮人常常在森林里遇到野兽而不感觉恐惧的原故。其中委内瑞拉的加拉伊波人就这一点来说是生活得十分安全，并不感觉有任何不便。弗朗索瓦·柯勒阿曾经说过：虽然他们几乎是赤身裸体的，却很大胆地出现于森林之中，所携带的武器不过是弓和箭，但是人们从未听说过他们当中有人被野兽吞噬了。

There are other, more formidable enemies, against which man does not have the same means of self-defense: natural infirmities, childhood, old age, and illnesses of all kinds— sad signs of our weakness, of which the first two are common to all animals, with the last belonging principally to man living in society. On the subject of childhood, I even observe that a mother, by carrying her child everywhere with her, can feed it much more easily than females of several animal species, which are forced to be continually coming and going, with great fatigue, to seek their food and to suckle or feed their young. It is true that if a woman were to perish, the child runs a considerable risk of perishing with her. But this danger is common to a hundred other species, whose young are for quite some time incapable of going off to seek their nourishment for themselves. Moreover, although childhood is longer among us, our life span is also longer; thus things are more or less 

>29 [Francisco Coreal (1648– 1708) wrote an account of his voyages to the West Indies.]


### 50
equal in this respect, although there are other rules, not relevant to my subject, that are concerned with the duration of infancy and the number of young. viii Among the elderly, who are less active and perspire little, the need for food diminishes with the capacity to provide for it. In addition, since savage life shields them from gout and rheumatism, and since old age is, of all ills, the one that human assistance can least alleviate, they eventually die without anyone being aware that they are ceasing to exist, and almost without being aware of it themselves. 
>另外有一些更可怕的，没有适当方法可以防御的敌人，那就是幼弱、衰老和各种疾病等天然缺陷。这些都是人类的弱点的悲惨表征，其中前两种是各种动物所共有的，而最后一种主要是在社会中过生活的人所具有的。关于幼弱问题，我曾观察到，在人类中母亲无论到什么地方都可以携带她的幼儿，因此她喂养幼儿，就比起必须忍受疲劳不停地来来往往，一面寻找食物，一面哺乳或喂养幼儿的许多母兽便利得多了。固然，如果母亲一旦死亡，孩子便很有跟着死亡的可能，但是这种危险，是其他无数种类的动物所共有的，因为这些动物的幼小在长时期内不能自己寻觅食物；而人类的幼弱时期虽然较长，但生命也比较长，因此，在这一点上，人和其他动物差不多是相等的，虽然在幼年发育期的长短上、幼儿数目的多寡上，还存在着别的规律，但这不是我所要研究的问题。在老年人方面，他们活动和出汗的机会都减少了，食物的需要也随着寻找食物的能力而减少。由于他们所过的野蛮生活，使他们不会得风湿病和关节炎，而衰老又是一切痛苦中人类最无力解除的一种痛苦，因此，老人们终于无声无息地逝去，不但别人不会注意到他们的生命的结束，就连他们自己也不会意识到自己的死亡。

With regard to illnesses, I will not repeat the vain and false pronouncements made against medicine by the majority of people in good health. Rather, I will ask whether there is any solid observation on the basis of which one can conclude that the average life span is shorter in those countries where the art of medicine is most neglected than in those where it is cultivated most assiduously. And how could that be the case, unless we give ourselves more ills than medicine can furnish us remedies? The extreme inequality in our lifestyle: excessive idleness among some, excessive labor among others; the ease with which we arouse and satisfy our appetites and our sensuality; the overly refined foods of the wealthy, which nourish them with irritating juices and overwhelm them with indigestion; the bad food of the poor, who most of the time do not have even that, and who, for want of food, are inclined to stuff their stomachs greedily whenever possible; staying up until all hours, excesses of all kinds, immoderate outbursts of every passion, bouts of fatigue and mental exhaustion; countless sorrows and afflictions, which are felt in all levels of society and which perpetually gnaw away at souls: these are the fatal proofs that most of our ills are of our own making, and that we could have avoided nearly all of them by preserving the simple, regular, and solitary lifestyle prescribed to us by nature. If nature has destined us to be healthy, I almost dare to affirm that the state of reflection is a state contrary to nature and that the man who meditates is a depraved animal. When one thinks about the stout constitutions of the savages, at least of those whom we have not ruined with our strong liquors; when one becomes aware of the fact that they know almost no illnesses but wounds and old age, one is strongly inclined to believe that someone could easily write the history of human maladies by following the history of civil societies. This at least was the opinion of Plato, who believed that, from certain remedies used or approved by Podalirius and Machaon at the siege of Troy, various illnesses which these remedies should exacerbate were as yet unknown among men,[30] 
>关于疾病，我决不重复大多数身体健康的人所发的反对医学的肤浅荒谬的言论。但是我要问一问是否有某种确切的观察，使我们可借以断定：在医术最被忽视的地方，比起最注意研究医术的地方，人的平均寿命要短一些。倘若我们自己给自己造成的疾病比医学所能提供给我们的治疗方法还要多的话，那应当怎样解释呢？生活方式上的极度不平等，一些人的过度闲逸，另一些人的过度劳累；食欲和性欲的易于激起和易于得到满足；富人们过于考究的食品，供给他们增加热量的养分，同时却使他们受到消化不良的苦痛；穷人们的食物不但粗劣，甚至时常缺乏这种食物，以致一有机会他们便不免贪食，因而加重肠胃的负担；彻夜不眠以及种种的过度；各种情欲的放纵，体力的疲劳和精神的涸竭；在种种情况下人们所感受到的无数烦恼和痛苦，使他们的心灵得不到片刻安宁。这一切都是不幸的凭证，足以证明人类的不幸大部分都是人类自己造成的，同时也证明，如果我们能够始终保持自然给我们安排的简朴、单纯、孤独的生活方式，我们几乎能够完全免去这些不幸。如果自然曾经注定了我们是健康的人，我几乎敢于断言，思考的状态是违反自然的一种状态，而沉思的人乃是一种变了质的动物。当人们想到野蛮人——至少是我们还没有用强烈的酒浆败坏了他们的体质的那些野蛮人——的优良体质时，当人们知道他们除受伤和衰老以外几乎不晓得其他疾病时，我们便不得不相信：循着文明社会的发展史，便不难作出人类的疾病史。这至少是柏拉图的意见，他曾根据波达利尔和马卡翁两人在特罗瓦城被围时②所使用过或赞许过的一些药物来推断说，这些药物所引起的各种疾病，当时尚未被人们所认识。赛尔斯①也说过，节食疗法——对于现在的人们是非常必要的——是伊波克拉特发明的。

With so few sources of ills, man in the state of nature hardly has any need therefore of remedies, much less of physicians. The human race is in

no worse condition than all the others in this respect; and it is easy to learn from hunters whether in their pursuit they find many sick animals. They find quite a few that have received serious wounds that healed quite nicely, that have had bones or even limbs broken and reset with no other surgeon than time, no other regimen than their everyday life, and that are no less perfectly cured for not having been tormented with incisions, poisoned with drugs, or exhausted with fasting. Finally, however correctly administered medicine may be among us, it is still certain that although a sick savage, abandoned to himself, has nothing to hope for except from nature, on the other hand, he has nothing to fear except his illness. This frequently makes his situation preferable to ours. 
>处在自然状态中的人，既然疾病的来源那么少，因此，几乎不需要药物，尤其不需要医生。在这方面，人类的情况并不逊于其他各类动物的情况。从猎人那里我们不难了解，他们在打猎的时候，是否遇到很多有残疾的动物。他们曾经遇到不少的动物受过严重的创伤而已很好地结了疤，有的曾经折断了骨头甚或肢体，但它们的痊愈并不是由于外科医生的治疗，而是由于时间的经过，除平常生活外，也没有任何生活上的护理，同时，它们也不曾受过手术的痛苦和药品的毒害以及忌食的折磨，但它们的痊愈还是同样完好。总之，无论精良的医术，对于我们能有多么大的效用，但总可以断言，害病的野蛮人，虽然无人照管，除把希望寄托于自然外，别无指望，可是另一方面，他们除自己的疾病外，也别无畏惧，这就往往使得野蛮人的状况优于我们的状况。

Therefore we must take care not to confuse savage man with the men we have before our eyes. Nature treats all animals left to its care with a tenderness that seems to show how jealous it is of that right. The horse, the cat, the bull, even the ass, are usually taller, and all of them have a more robust constitution, more vigor, more strength, and more courage in the forests than in our homes. They lose half of these advantages in becoming domesticated; it might be said that all our efforts at feeding them and treating them well only end in their degeneration. It is the same for man himself. In becoming habituated to the ways of society and a slave, he becomes weak, fearful, and servile; his soft and effeminate lifestyle completes the enervation of both his strength and his courage. Let us add that the difference between the savage man and the domesticated man should be still greater than that between the savage animal and the domesticated animal; for while animal and man have been treated equally by nature, man gives more comforts to himself than to the animals he tames, and all of these comforts are so many specific causes that make him degenerate more noticeably. 
>因此，我们应当避免把野蛮人和我们目前所见的人混为一谈。自然用一种偏爱来对待所有在它照管之下的那些动物，这种偏爱好象是在表示自然如何珍视它对这些动物加以照管的权利。在森林里的马、猫、雄牛、甚至驴子，比在我们家里所饲养的大都有更高大的身躯，更强壮的体质，更多的精力、体力和胆量。它们一旦变成了家畜，便失去这些优点的大半，而且可以说，我们照顾和饲养这些牲畜的一切细心，结果反而使它们趋于退化。人也是这样，在他变成社会的人和奴隶的时候，也就成为衰弱的、胆小的、卑躬屈节的人；他的安乐而萎靡的生活方式，把他的力量和勇气同时销磨殆尽。而且野蛮人和文明人之间的差异，比野兽和家畜之间的差异必然还要大一些。因为自然对人和兽虽然一视同仁，而人给自己比给他所驯养的动物安排的种种享受要多得多，这便是人的退化所以更为显著的特殊原因。


It is therefore no great misfortune for those first men, nor, above all, great obstacle to their preservation, that they are naked, that they no dwelling, and that they lack all those useful things we take to be so necessary. If they do not have furry skin, they have no need for it in warm countries, and in cold countries they soon learn to help themselves to the skins of animals they have vanquished. If they have but two feet to run with, they have two arms to provide for their defense and for their needs. Perhaps their children learn to walk late and with difficulty, but mothers carry them easily: an advantage that is lacking in other species, where the mother, on being pursued, finds herself forced to abandon her young or to conform her pace to theirs.

Finally, unless we suppose those singular and fortuitous combinations of circumstances of which I will speak later, and which might very well have never taken place, at any rate it is clear that the first man who made clothing or a dwelling for himself was giving himself things that were hardly necessary, since he had done without them until then and since it is not clear why, as a grown man, he could not endure the kind of life he had endured ever since he was a child. 
>所以没有衣服、没有住外、没有那些在我们看来是那么必需的一切无用之物，对原始人来说，并不是多大的不幸。对于他们的自我保存更没有多大妨碍。他们虽然皮肤上没有生毛，那是因为在热带地方丝毫没有那种需要，倘若生在寒冷地带，他们很快就会利用所捕获的野兽的皮毛。他们虽然只有二足奔跑，但有双臂可用以自卫并供给自己的需要。他们的幼儿也许很晚才会走路，而且走起来颇为困难，但是母亲携带幼儿则很容易。这是别种动物所没有的一个优点。在别种动物，当母兽被追逐时，便不得不抛弃它的幼小，否则只有使自己的步子适应幼小的步子。关于这一点，可能有一些例外，我们可以举尼加拉瓜地方的一种动物作例子来说明。这种动物类似狐狸，它的足象人的手，根据柯勒阿的记载，它们肚下有一个肉袋，当母亲需要逃跑的时候，可以把小兽装在里面。毫无疑问，在墨西哥，人们称之为特拉瓜钦的也就是这种动物。据拉爱特说，这种动物的母兽肚下也有一个用途相同的类似的肉袋。总之，除非遇有我在下面所要谈到的那些情况（这些情况很可能永不发生）稀有的、偶然的会合，无论如何我们也不难明了：第一个为自己制作衣服或建筑住处的人，实际上不过是给自己创造了一些很不必要的东西。因为在此以前没有这些东西，他也照样生活，而且我们不能理解为什么他在长大以后反而不能忍受他自幼就能忍受的那种生活。

Alone, idle, and always near danger, savage man must like to sleep and be a light sleeper, like those animals that do little thinking and, as it were, sleep the entire time they are not thinking. Since his self-preservation was practically his sole concern, his best-trained faculties ought to be those that have attack and defense as their principal object, either to subjugate his prey or to prevent his becoming the prey of another animal. On the other hand, the organs that are perfected only by softness and sensuality must remain in a state of crudeness that excludes any kind of refinement in him. And with his senses being divided in this respect, he will have extremely crude senses of touch and taste; those of sight, hearing, and smell will have the greatest subtlety. Such is the state of animals in general, and, according to the reports of travelers, such also is that of the majority of savage peoples. Thus we should not be surprised that the Hottentots of the Cape of Good Hope can sight ships with the naked eye as far out at sea as the Dutch can with telescopes; or that the savages of America were as capable of trailing Spaniards by smell as the best dogs could have done; or that all these barbarous nations endure their nakedness with no discomfort, whet their appetites with hot peppers, and drink European liquors like water.[32]
>孤独的、清闲的、并且时常会遭到危险的野蛮人，必定喜欢睡眠，并容易惊醒，如同其他不大用思想的动物一样，可以说，在不思想的时候，总在睡眠。自我保存，几乎是他唯一关怀的事情，他所最熟练的能力必然是为了制服他的俘获物或者为了不作其他野兽的俘获物，而以攻击和防御为主要目的的一些能力。相反地，只因逸乐和肉欲才能趋于完善的器官，在他身上必然停留在粗鄙状态，因为这种状态是与一切文雅相排斥的。因此，在这方面他的各种感官就分化为两种迥然不同的情况：触觉和味觉极端迟钝，视觉听觉和嗅觉则最锐敏不过。这是动物的一般状态，据旅行家们的记载，这也是大部分野蛮人的状态。所以我们丝毫不必惊讶：为什么好望角的霍屯督人能用肉眼发现海上的船只和荷兰人用望远镜看得一般远；为什么美洲的野蛮人象最好的猎狗一样，能够由足迹嗅得出西班牙人的行径；为什么所有这些野蛮人，不因裸体而感到痛苦，用辣椒来刺激他们的味觉，并且饮欧洲人的烈酒象喝水一样。 

So far I have considered only physical man. Let us now try to look at him from a metaphysical and moral point of view. 
>直到这里为止，我只从生理方面对人进行了研究，现在让我从形而上学和精神方面来对人加以观察。

In any animal I see nothing but an ingenious machine to which nature has given senses in order for it to renew its strength and to protect itself, to a certain point, from all that tends to destroy or disturb it. I am aware of precisely the same things in the human machine, with the difference that nature alone does everything in the operations of an animal, whereas man contributes as a free agent to his own operations. The former chooses or rejects by instinct and the later by an act of freedom. Hence an animal cannot deviate from the rule that is prescribed to it, even when it would be advantageous to do so, while man deviates from it, often to his own detriment. Thus a pigeon would die of hunger near a bowl filled with choice meats, and so would a cat perched atop a pile of fruit or grain, even though both could nourish themselves quite

well with the food they disdain, if they were of a mind to try some. And thus dissolute men abandon themselves to excesses that cause them fever and death, because the mind perverts the senses and because the will still speaks when nature is silent. 
>在我看来，任何一个动物无非是一部精巧的机器①，自然给这部机器一些感官，使它自己活动起来，并在某种程度上对于一切企图毁灭它或干扰它的东西实行自卫。在人体这部机器上，我恰恰看到同样的东西，但有这样一个差别：在禽兽的动作中，自然支配一切，而人则以自由主动者的资格参与其本身的动作。禽兽根据本能决定取舍，而人则通过自由行为决定取舍。因此，禽兽虽在对它有利的时候，也不会违背自然给它规定的规则，而人则往往虽对自己有害也会违背这种规则。正因为这样，一只鸽子会饿死在满盛美味的肉食的大盆旁边；一只猫会饿死在水果或谷物堆上，其实这两种动物，如果想到去尝试一下，并不是不能以它们所不喜欢的食物为生的。正因为这样，一些生活放荡的人，才会耽溺于招致疾病或死亡的种种淫乐，因为精神能使感官遭受败坏，当自然的需要已经得到满足的时候，意志却还提出要求。

Every animal has ideas, since it has senses; up to a certain point it even combines its ideas, and in this regard man differs from an animal only in degree. Some philosophers have even suggested that there is a greater difference between two given men than between a given man and an animal. Therefore it is not so much understanding that causes the specific distinction of man from all other animals as it is his being a free agent. Nature commands every animal, and the beasts obey. Man feels the same impetus, but he knows he is free to go along or to resist; and it is above all in the awareness of this freedom that the spirituality of his soul is made manifest. For physics explains in some way the mechanism of the senses and the formation of ideas; but in the power of willing, or rather of choosing, and in the feeling of this power, we find only purely spiritual acts, about which the laws of mechanics explain nothing. 
>一切动物，既然都有感官，所以也都有观念，甚至还会把这些观念在某种程度上联结起来。在这一点上，人与禽兽不过是程度之差。某些哲学家甚至进一步主张，这一个人和那一个人之间的差别，比这一个人和那一个禽兽之间的差别还要大。因此，在一切动物之中，区别人的主要特点的，与其说是人的悟性，不如说是人的自由主动者的资格。自然支配着一切动物，禽兽总是服从；人虽然也受到同样的支配，却认为自己有服从或反抗的自由。而人特别是因为他能意识到这种自由，因而才显示出他的精神的灵性。因为，物理学能够在某种意义上解释感官的机械作用和观念的形成，但是在人的意志力或者勿宁说选择力方面以及对于这种力的意识方面，我们只能发现一些纯精神性的活动，这些活动都不能用力学的规律来解释。

But if the difficulties surrounding all these questions should leave some room for dispute on this difference between man and animal, there is another very specific quality that distinguishes them and about which there can be no argument: the faculty of self-perfection, a faculty that, with the aid of circumstances, successively develops all the others, and resides among us as much in the species as in the individual. On the other hand, an animal, at the end of a few months, is what it will be all its life; and its species, at the end of a thousand years, is what it was in the first of those thousand years. Why is man alone subject to becoming an imbecile? Is it not that he thereby returns to his primitive state, and that, while the animal which has acquired nothing and which also has nothing to lose, always retains its instinct, man, in losing through old age or other accidents all that his perfectibility[33] has enabled him to acquire, thus falls even lower than the animal itself? It would be sad for us to be forced to agree that this distinctive and almost unlimited faculty is the source of all man’s misfortunes; that this is what, by dint of time, draws him out of that original condition in which he would pass tranquil and innocent days; that this is what, through the centuries unfolds both his enlightenment and his errors, his vices and his virtues, and eventually makes him a tyrant over himself and nature. ix It would be dreadful to be obliged to praise as a beneficent being the one who first suggested to the inhabitant on the banks of the Orinoco the use of boards that he binds to his children’s temples, and that assure them of at least part of their imbecility and their original happiness. 
>但是，尽管围绕着所有这些问题的种种疑难之点，使我们在人与禽兽之间的区别上还有争论的余地，然而另外有一种区分二者的非常显明的特质则是无可争辩的，这种特质就是自我完善化的能力。这种能力，借助于环境的影响，继续不断地促进所有其他能力的发展，而且这种能力既存在于个人身上，也存在于整个种类之中。至于一只兽则几个月后就长成它终身不变的那个样子，而且它的种类，即使再过一千年也仍然和这一千年开始的时候完全一样。为什么只有人类易于衰颓下去呢？是不是人类因此又返还到它的原始状态呢？是不是禽兽之所以永远保持着它的本能，是因为它既毫无所得，也就毫无所失，而人类却由于古老或由于其他偶然事故丧失了曾因它的完善化的能力所获得的一切，从而堕入比禽兽还不如的状态呢？如果我们不得不承认：这种特殊而几乎无限的能力，正是人类一切不幸的源泉；正是这种能力，借助于时间的作用使人类脱离了它曾在其中度过安宁而淳朴的岁月的原始状态；正是这种能力，在各个时代中，使人显示出他的智慧和谬误、邪恶和美德，终于使他成为人类自己的和自然界的暴君，这对我们说来，就未免太可悲了。奥里诺科河沿岸的居民，用木片贴在他们小孩的太阳穴上，认为这样至少可以保持小孩一部分的纯朴无知和本来幸福。如果我们不得不把这种办法的创始者歌颂为造福人群的人物，这就未免太可怕了。

Savage man, left by nature to instinct alone, or rather compensated for the instincts he is perhaps lacking by faculties capable of first replacing them and then of raising him to the level of instinct, will therefore begin with purely

### 54
animal functions. x Perceiving and feeling will be his first state, which he will have in common with all animals. Willing and not willing, desiring, and fearing will be the first and nearly the only operations of his soul until new circumstances bring about new developments in it. 
>在自然的支配下，野蛮人仅只服从于他的本能，或者更确切地说，自然为了补偿野蛮人在本能方面可能有的缺陷，赋予他一些能力，这些能力首先可以弥补他的缺陷，嗣后还可以把他提高到远远超过本能状态之上。因此，野蛮人最初所具有的只是一些纯动物性的能力。视觉和感觉或许是野蛮人最初的本能状态，这种状态是他和一切动物所共有的。愿意和不愿意，希望和畏惧，直到新的情况使他的精神有新的发展为止，可能是他最初的，几乎仅有的精神活动。

Whatever the moralists may say about it, human understanding owes much to the passions, which, by common consensus, also owe a great deal to it. It is by their activity that our reason is perfected. We seek to know only because we desire to find enjoyment; and it is impossible to conceive why someone who had neither desires nor fears would go to the bother of reasoning. The passions in turn take their origin from our needs, and their progress from our knowledge. For one can desire or fear things only by virtue of the ideas one can have of them, or from the simple impulse of nature; and savage man, deprived of every sort of enlightenment, feels only the passions of this latter sort. His desires do not go beyond his physical needs. xi The only goods he knows in the universe are nourishment, a woman, and rest; the only evils he fears are pain and hunger. I say pain and not death because an animal will never know what it is to die; and knowledge of death and its terrors is one of the first acquisitions that man has made in withdrawing from the animal condition. 
>无论伦理学家们怎样主张人的悟性在很大程度上依赖于情感；但大家公认，情感也在很大程度上依赖于悟性。由于情感的活动，我们的理性才能够趋于完善。我们所以求知，无非是因为希望享受；既没有欲望也没有恐惧的人而肯费力去推理，那是不可思议的。情感本身来源于我们的需要，而情感的发展则来源于我们的认识。因为人只在对于某些事物能够具有一定观念的时候，或者是由于单纯的自然冲动，才会希望或畏惧那些事物。野蛮人由于缺乏各种智慧，只能具有因自然冲动而产生的情感。他的欲望决不会超出他的生理上的需要。在宇宙中他所认识的唯一需要就是食物、异性和休息；他所畏惧的唯一灾难就是疼痛和饥饿。我说疼痛，而不说死亡，因为一般动物从来不知道死亡是怎么一回事；对死亡的认识和恐怖，乃是人类脱离动物状态后最早的“收获”之一。

Were it necessary, it would be easy for me to support this view with facts and to demonstrate that, among all the nations of the world, the progress of the mind has been precisely proportionate to the needs received by peoples from nature or to those needs to which circumstances have subjected them, and consequently to the passions that inclined them to provide for those needs. I would show the arts 34 coming into being in Egypt and spreading with the flooding of the Nile. I would follow their progress among the Greeks, where they were seen to germinate, grow, and rise to the heavens among the sands and rocks of Attica, though never being able to take root on the fertile banks of the Eurotas. 35 I would point out that in general the peoples of the north are more industrious than those of the south, because they cannot get along as well without being so, as if nature thereby wanted to equalize things by giving to their minds the fertility it refuses their soil.[36] 
>如果有必要的话，不难用事实来支持我这种看法，也不难证明在世界各民族中，智慧的进步，恰恰是和各族人民的天然需要，或者因环境的要求而必然产生的需要成正比的，因此也是和促使他们去满足那些需要的种种欲望成正比的。我可以指出，在埃及，艺术随着尼罗河的泛滥而产生并发达起来。我可以追寻艺术在希腊的进展情况：人们在那里曾看到，各种艺术在阿提喀的沙滩和岩石间繁荣滋长，乃至高与天齐，但在奥罗塔斯河肥沃的两岸上则不能生根。我还可以指出，北方的民族一般说来比南方的民族较为智巧，因为他们非如此不能生活下去。好象自然愿意这样调整事物以使它们趋于平等，在它拒绝把富绕给与土地的地方，便把富饶赐给了精神。

But without having recourse to the uncertain testimonies of history, does anyone fail to see that everything seems to remove savage man from the temptation and the means of ceasing to be savage? His imagination depicts nothing to him; his heart asks nothing of him. His modest needs are so easily found at hand, and he is so far from the degree of knowledge necessary to make him desire to acquire greater knowledge, that he can have neither foresight nor curiosity. The spectacle of nature becomes a matter of indifference 

>34 [Rousseau’s word arts includes the mechanical arts or technology; indeed, here it refers specifically to technology.] 35 [The Eurotas runs through Sparta.] 36 [Cf. Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws, bk. 18, ch. 4.]

to him by dint of its becoming familiar to him. It is always the same order, always the same succession of changes. He does not have a mind for marveling at the greatest wonders; and we must not seek in him the philosophy that a man needs in order to know how to observe once what he has seen every day. His soul, agitated by nothing, is given over to the single feeling of his own present existence, without any idea of the future, however near it may be, and his projects, as limited as his views, hardly extend to the end of the day. Such is, even today, the extent of the Carib’s foresight. In the morning he sells his bed of cotton and in the evening he returns in tears to buy it back, for want of having foreseen that he would need it that night.[37]
>但是，即使不借助于历史上不可尽信的凭证，谁能看不出一切都似乎使野蛮人难以有不再作野蛮人的企图和方法呢？他的想象不能给他描绘什么；他的心灵不会向他要求什么。由于他那有限的一点需要十分容易随手得到满足，而他又远没有达到一定程度的知识水平，因而也没有取得更高知识的欲望，所以他既不可能有什么预见，也不可能有什么好奇心。自然景象，一经他熟悉以后，便再也引不起他的注意。万物的秩序、时节的运转总是始终如一的。他没有足够的智慧来欣赏那些最伟大的奇迹，我们不能设想他已有了人所必须具备的智慧，使他会来观察一下他每日所见到的事物。在他那什么都搅扰不了的心灵里，只有对自己目前生存的感觉，丝毫没有将来的观念，无论是多么近的将来。他的计划，也象他的眼光那样局促，几乎连一天以内的事情都预见不到。现在加拉伊波人的预见程度，还是这样。他们早上卖掉棉褥，晚上为了再去买回而痛哭，全不能预见当天晚上还要用它。

The more one meditates on this subject, the more the distance from pure sensations to the simplest knowledge increases before our eyes; and it is impossible to conceive how a man could have crossed such a wide gap by his forces alone, without the aid of communication and without the provocation of necessity. How many centuries have perhaps gone by before men were in a position to see any fire other than that from the heavens? How many different risks did they have to run before they learned the most common uses of that element? How many times did they let it go out before they had acquired the art of reproducing it? And how many times perhaps did each of these secrets die with the one who had discovered it? What will we say about agriculture, an art that requires so much labor and foresight, that depends on so many other arts, that quite obviously is practicable only in a society which is at least in its beginning stages, and that serves us not so much to derive from the earth food it would readily provide without agriculture, as to force from it those preferences that are most to our taste? But let us suppose that people multiplied to the point where the natural productions were no longer sufficient to nourish them: a supposition that, it may be said in passing, would show a great advantage for the human species in that way of life. Let us suppose that, without forges or workshops, farm implements had fallen from the heavens into the hands of the savages; that these men had conquered the mortal hatred they all have for continuous work; that they had learned to foresee their needs far enough in advance; that they had guessed how the soil is to be cultivated, grains sown, and trees planted; that they had discovered the arts of grinding wheat and fermenting grapes: all things they would need to have been taught by the gods, for it is inconceivable how they could have picked these things up on their own. Yet, after all this, what man would be so foolish as to tire himself out cultivating a field that will be plundered by the first comer, be it man or beast, who takes a fancy to the crop? And how could each man resolve to spend his life in hard labor, when, the more necessary to him the fruits of his labor may be, the surer he is of not realizing them? In a word, how could this situation lead men to cultivate the soil as long as

it is not divided among them, that is to say, as long as the state of nature is not wiped out?
>我们越对这一问题深思熟虑，便越会看出纯粹的感觉和最简单的知识之间的距离。一个人如何能够不假交往的关系和需要的刺激，而单凭自己的力量，越过这样大的距离，乃是不可思议的事。多少世纪过去以后，人们才能够看到雷电以外的火！为了使他们学会这种元素最平常的用法，需要多少不同的偶然事件啊！他们曾经任凭它熄灭过多少次才获得取火的技术呢？而且，也许这种秘诀不知曾经随着发明者的死亡而消失过多少次！对于农业，我们将持什么说法呢？它要求那么多的劳动和预见，它依赖于许多别的技术；很明显，只有建立了社会以后，至少是在已经开始建立了社会的地方才能够从事这种技术。而且从事农业多半不是为了从土地中获得一些无须农业也会获得的食料，而是要使土地生产一些最适合我们口味的东西。但是，假定由于人类大量的繁殖，以至自然产品已经不足以养活他们（我顺便指出，这种假定足以证明当时人们的生活方式对于人类毕竟是很有益的）；假定虽然没有炼铁厂和制造厂，耕种的工具已由天上掉到野蛮人手里；假定这些人已经克服了他们所普遍具有的、对于继续不断的劳动无比的厌恶；假定他们已经学会很早就预见到他们的需要；假定他们已经猜想出应该怎样耕种土地、播散种籽、栽植树木；假定他们已经发明了磨麦和酿酒的技术（所有这些事情，想必是神明教会了他们的，因为很难想象人类最初自己怎么能学会这些技术），即便是这样的话，如果他们耕耘的收获会被第一个无意中走来、看中这些收获的人或野兽抢走，试问，谁还会那么愚蠢，肯于自寻苦恼从事耕耘呢？尤其是当他们准知道他们劳动的成果越为他们所需要反而越不会得到的时候，试问，谁还肯终生从事于艰苦的劳动呢？总之，在这种情况下，即在土地还没有被分配，也就是说，自然状态还没有消灭以前，如何能使人乐于耕种土地呢？

Were we to want to suppose a savage man as skilled in the art of thinking as our philosophers make him out to be; were we, following their example, to make him a full-fledged philosopher, discovering by himself the most sublime truths, and, by chains of terribly abstract reasoning, forming for himself maxims of justice and reason drawn from the love of order in general or from the known will of his creator; in a word, were we to suppose there was as much intelligence and enlightenment in his mind as he needs, and as he is in fact found to have been possessed of dullness and stupidity, what use would the species have for all that metaphysics, which could not be communicated and which would perish with the individual who would have invented it? What progress could the human race make, scattered in the woods among the animals? And to what extent could men mutually perfect and enlighten one another, when, with neither a fixed dwelling nor any need for one another, they would hardly encounter one another twice in their lives, without knowing or talking to one another? 
>倘若我们假定野蛮人在思维艺术上已达到现代哲学家们所说的那种巧妙程度，倘若我们也仿效哲学家们的榜样，把野蛮人也看成是一个哲学家，能够独自发现最崇高的真理，并且能够通过一系列很抽象的推理，从对宇宙秩序的热爱中，或从造物主所显示出的意旨中，创造出正义和理性的格言；总之，倘若我们假定野蛮人在精神方面已具有那样的聪明和智慧，而实际上，我们却发现他是迟钝而愚蠢的，那么，人类从这种不能彼此传授并随发明者的死亡而消失的全部形而上学中能得到什么益处呢？散处在森林里并杂居于群兽之中的人类能有什么进步呢？没有一定住所，谁也不需要谁，一生之中彼此也许遇不上两次，互不相识，互不交谈的人们，他们能够自我完善化和相互启发到什么程度呢？

Let us consider how many ideas we owe to the use of speech; how much grammar trains and facilitates the operations of the mind. And let us think of the inconceivable difficulties and the infinite amount of time that the first invention of languages must have cost. Let us join their reflections to the preceding ones, and we will be in a position to judge how many thousands of centuries would have been necessary to develop successively in the human mind the operations of which it was capable. 
>试想一想，有多少观念的产生应归功于语言的使用，而语法对于锻炼和促进精神活动又起着多么大的作用；试想一想最初发明语言所应经历的难以想象的困难以及所应花费的无限时间。请把这些考虑和上面的种种考虑加在一起，便可以判断，要在人的头脑中陆续发展他所能从事的这些精神活动，曾经需要经历几千百个世纪呢？


May I be permitted to consider for a moment the obstacles to the origin of languages. I could be content here to cite or repeat the investigations that the abbot de Condillac has made on this matter, all of which completely confirm my view, and may perhaps have given me the idea in the first place.[38] But since the way in which this philosopher resolves the difficulties he himself raises concerning the origin of conventional signs shows that he assumed what I question (namely, a kind of society already established among the inventors of language), I believe that in referring to his reflections I must add to them my own, in order to present the same difficulties from a standpoint that is pertinent to my subject. The first that presents itself is to imagine how languages could have become necessary; for since men had no communication among themselves nor any need for it, I fail to see either the necessity of this invention or its possibility, if it were not indispensable. I might well say, as do many others, that languages were born in the domestic intercourse among fathers, mothers, and children. But aside from the fact that this would not resolve the difficulties, it would make the mistake of those who, reasoning about the state of nature, intrude into it ideas taken from society. They

always see the family gathered in one and the same dwelling, with its members maintaining among themselves a union as intimate and permanent as exists among us, where so many common interests unite them. But the fact of the matter is that in that primitive state, since nobody had houses or huts or property of any kind, each one bedded down in some random spot and often for only one night. Males and females came together fortuitously as a result of chance encounters, occasion, and desire, without there being any great need for words to express what they had to say to one another. They left one another with the same nonchalance. xii The mother at first nursed her children for her own need; then, with habit having endeared them to her, she later nourished them for their own need. Once they had the strength to look for their food, they did not hesitate to leave the mother herself. And since there was practically no other way of finding one another than not to lose sight of one another, they were soon at the point of not even recognizing one another. It should also be noted that, since the child had all his needs to explain and consequently more things to say to the mother than the mother to the child, it is the child who must make the greatest effort toward inventing a language, and that the language he uses should in large part be of his own making, which multiplies languages as many times as there are individuals to speak them. This tendency was abetted by a nomadic and vagabond life, which does not give any idiom time to gain a foothold. For claiming that the mother teaches her child the words he ought to use in asking her for this or that is a good way of showing how already-formed languages are taught, but it does not tell us how languages are formed. 
>请允许我用少许时间来考虑语言起源上的一些难题，我想，在这里引证或重述一下孔狄亚克神父对这个问题所作的研究就够了。这些研究不但完全证实了我的意见，也许还启发了我关于这个问题的最初观念。但是从这位哲学家解决他在设定符号的起源问题上给自己提出的难题时所采用的方法看来，说明他是把我认为成问题的东西当作了前提，即：在创立语言的人们之间，已经建立了某种社会，因此，我认为在引用他的意见时，应当附加上我的意见，以便把同样的难题从适合于我的主题的角度来加以说明。首先呈现出的难题，是想象语言怎么会成为必要的。因为，人与人之间既然没有任何来往，也没有任何来往的需要，则语言的发明并不是必不可少的，那么，我们就无法设想这种发明的必要，也无法设想这种发明的可能。我很可以象其他许多人一样，认为语言是在父母子女之间家庭生活的日常接触中产生的。但是这种说法，不但丝毫不能解决我们的疑难，而且还会和那些把在社会中所获得的观念硬搬到自然状态上去的人们犯了同样错误。他们总以为一个家庭聚集在一个共同住所里，家庭成员们彼此间保持着一种同我们现在一样的亲密而永久的结合，是由许多共同利益把他们结合起来的。其实在原始状态中，既没有住宅，也没有茅屋，又没有任何种类的财产，每个人随便住在一个地方，而且往往只住一夜。男女两性的结合也是偶然的，或因巧遇，或因机缘，或因意愿关系，并不需要语言作为他们彼此间表达意思的工具。他们的分离也是同样很容易的。母亲哺乳幼儿，起初只是为了她自己生理上的需要，后来由于习惯使她觉得小孩可爱，她才为了小孩的需要而喂养他们。但是，孩子一旦有了自己寻找食物的能力，就毫不迟疑地离开母亲；而且，他们除了永不失散，谁也看得见谁以外，几乎没有任何其他保持互相认识的方法，因此他们往往会很快就互不相识了。此外，我们还应当指明，小孩要向人表达他的许多需要，因此他想向母亲说的事情比母亲想向他说的还要多。对于发明语言尽最大努力的应当是小孩，并且他所使用的语言，大部分应当是出自他自己的创造。这样，语言的种类势必随着以语言来表达意思的人数而增多，加以飘泊不定的生活，使得任何用语都没有机会固定下来，更助长了这种情况的发展。如果说是母亲教导小孩学语，使他用来向她要这件或那件东西，这种说法固然足以说明人们怎样教那已经形成了的语言，却丝毫不能说明语言是怎样形成的。

Let us suppose this first difficulty has been overcome. Let us disregard for a moment the immense space that there must have been between the pure state of nature and the need for languages. And, on the supposition that they are necessary, xiii let us inquire how they might have begun to be established. Here we come to a new difficulty, worse still than the preceding one. For if men needed speech in order to learn to think, they had a still greater need for knowing how to think in order to discover the art of speaking. And even if it were understood how vocal sounds had been taken for the conventional expressions of our ideas, it would still remain for us to determine what could have been the conventional expressions for ideas that, not having a sensible object, could not be indicated either by gesture or by voice. Thus we are scarcely able to form tenable conjectures regarding the birth of this art of communicating thoughts and establishing intercourse between minds, a sublime art that is already quite far from its origin, but which the philosopher still sees at so prodigious a distance from its perfection that there is no man so foolhardy as to claim that it will ever achieve it, even if the sequences of change that time necessarily brings were suspended in its favor, even if prejudices were to be barred from the academies or be silent before them, and even if they were able to occupy themselves with that thorny problem for whole centuries without interruption.
>假定这第一个疑难已经解决了，让我们暂且跨过介于纯粹的自然状态与语言的需要之间的漫长时间；并让我们在假定语言是必要的这一前提下来研究语言如何能够开始建立起来。这是比前一难题更不易解决的难题。因为，如果说人们为了学习思维而需要语言，那末，他们为了发明语言的艺术则更需要先知道如何思维。而且纵然我们可以理解声音的音响是怎样被用作传达我们观念的约定工具，我们仍须进一步探讨，当初对于那些不以感性实物为对象、既不能用手势又不能用声音表示出来的观念，又将约定什么样的工具来传达呢？关于这种传达思想和建立精神联系的艺术的诞生，我们几乎不能作出一些可以说得过去的猜测。语言这一崇高的艺术距离它的起源已经那么远，可是哲学家们还在一个离其完善化如此不可思议的距离来研究它，因而，没有一个这样大胆的人敢于断言这一艺术怎么会终于达到了它完善化的境地，纵使由于时间而必然引起的变革对于这一艺术可能不发生任何影响；纵使学者们能够捐弃他们的一切偏见，或者不再主张他们的那些偏见；纵使学术界能够毫不间断地从事这个棘手问题的研究达数世纪之久，恐怕也没有人敢作这种断言。

Man’s first language, the most universal, the most energetic, and the only language he needed before it was necessary to persuade men assembled together, is the cry of nature. Since this cry was elicited only by a kind of instinct in pressing circumstances, to beg for help in great dangers, or for relief of violent ills, it was not used very much in the ordinary course of life, where more moderate feelings prevail. When the ideas of men begin to spread and multiply, and closer communication was established among them, they sought more numerous signs and a more extensive language. They multiplied vocal inflections and combined them with gestures, which, by their nature, are more expressive, and whose meaning is less dependent on a prior determination. They therefore signified visible and mobile objects by means of gestures and audible ones by imitative sounds. But since a gesture indicates hardly anything more than present or easily described objects and visible actions; since its use is not universal, because darkness or the interposition of a body renders it useless; and since it requires rather than stimulates attention, men finally thought of replacing them with vocal articulations, which, while not having the same relationship to certain ideas, were better suited to represent all ideas as conventional signs. Such a substitution could only be made by a common consent and in a way rather difficult to practice for men whose crude organs had as yet no exercise, and still more difficult to conceive in itself, since that unanimous agreement had to have had a motive, and speech appears to have been necessary in order to establish the use of speech.
>人类最初的语言，也就是说，在人类还没有必要用语言来劝诱群居的人们以前，所使用的最普遍的、最有力的、唯一的语言，就是自然的呼声。因为它是在紧急情况之下，由于一种本能而发出来的，它的用途不过是在大的危险中求人救助、或在剧烈疼痛中希望减轻痛苦，所以在比较有节制的情感支配着的日常生活中，人们并不常常使用这种呼声。当人类的观念逐渐扩展和增多时，并且在人们之间建立起更密切的来往时，他们便想制定更多的符号和一种更广泛的语言。他们增多了声音的抑扬，并且加上了手势。手势按它的性质来说，有较强的表现力，而它的意义也不大需要预先规定。于是他们用手势来表示那些可以看得见和可以移动的东西，用模拟的声音来表示那些听得见的东西。但是手势除表示眼前的和容易描绘的东西以及看得见的动作以外，几乎不能表示其他事物；光线不足或中间有什么东西阻隔就可以使它失去效用，而且手势与其说是引起注意的，不如说是要求注意的，所以不能普遍地使用；人们终于设法用声音的音节来代替手势，这些音节虽然同某些观念并没有同一的关系，但它们却更适于作为制定的符号来代表所有这些观念。不过这种代替，只有通过全体一致的同意才能成立，这对于那些粗糙的器官还没有经过什么练习的人们来说，是很难实行的。这种代替，其本身也是难以理解的，因为要获得一致同意就必须说明理由，那么，在制定语言的时候，语言的使用似乎是已经成为十分必要的了。

We must infer that the first words men used had a much broader meaning in their mind than do those used in languages that are already formed; and that, being ignorant of the division of discourse into its constitutive parts, at first they gave each word the meaning of a whole sentence. When they began to distinguish subject from attribute and verb from noun, which was no mean effort of genius, substantives were at first only so many proper nouns; the infinitive was the only verb tense; and the notion of adjectives must have developed only with considerable difficulty, since every adjective is an abstract word, and abstractions are difficult and not particularly natural operations. 
> 我们可以这样推断，人们最初所使用的词，比语言已经形成后人们所使用的词，在他们的心灵中意义要广泛得多。而且最初他们不晓得把词句的各个构成部分加以区分，所以赋予每一个词以一整个词句的意义。当他们开始把主词和宾词分开、动词和名词分开的时候，那已是非凡的天才的努力。名词最初只是一些专门名词，原形动词的现在时态，是动词的唯一时态。关于形容词的概念，其发展必定经过了很大的困难，因为形容词，都是一些抽象的词，而对事物加以抽象，是困难而不大自然的活动。


At first each object was given a particular name without regard to genus and species that those first founders were not in a position to distinguish; and all individual things presented themselves to their minds in isolation, as they are in the spectacle of nature. If one oak tree was called A, another was called B. Thus the more limited the knowledge, the more extensive becomes the dictionary. The difficulty inherent in all this nomenclature could not easily be alleviated, for in order to group beings under various common and generic denominations, it was necessary to know their properties and their differences. What was needed were observations and definitions: that is to

### 59
say, natural history and metaphysics, which went far beyond anything the men of those times could have accomplished. 
>最初每个物体，只取得一个特有的名称，不管属性和种类，因为属性和种类是最初创立名词的人所不能区分的；而所有的个体，都孤立地照着它在自然景象里的样子反映在他们头脑中。如果一棵橡树叫作甲，另一棵就叫作乙，因为人们由两件东西所得到的第一个观念，就是它们并不是同一的；人们常常需要很多的时间才能观察出它们的共同点。因此，人们的认识越具有局限性，字暋就越庞杂。这种分类命名的困难是不易解除的，因为要把万物归纳起来给它们定一个代表种类的共同名称，需要认识事物的共同属性和彼此间的区别，需要一些观察和定义，也就是说，需要比那个时代的人所能有的远为丰富的关于博物学和形而上学的知识。

Moreover, general ideas can be introduced into the mind only with the aid of words, and the understanding grasps them only through sentences. That is one reason why animals cannot form such ideas or even acquire the perfectibility that depends on them. When a monkey moves unhesitatingly from one nut to another, does anyone think the monkey has the general idea of that type of fruit and that he compares its archetype with these two individuals? Undoubtedly not; but the sight of one of these nuts recalls to his memory the sensations he received of the other; and his eyes, modified in a certain way, announce to his sense of taste the modification it is about to receive. Every general idea is purely intellectual; but the slightest involvement of the imagination with it at once makes it particular. Try to draw for yourself the image of a tree in general; you will never succeed in doing it. In spite of yourself, it must be seen as small or large, barren or leafy, light or dark; and if you were in a position to see in it nothing but what you see in every tree, this image would no longer resemble a tree. Purely abstract beings are perceived in the same way, or are conceived only through discourse. The definition of a triangle alone gives you the true idea of it. As soon as you behold one in your mind, it is a particular triangle and not some other one, and you cannot avoid making its lines to be perceptible or its plane to have color. It is therefore necessary to utter sentences, and thus to speak, in order to have general ideas. For as soon as the imagination stops, the mind proceeds no further without the aid of discourse. If, then, the first inventors of language could give names only to ideas they already had, it follows that the first substantives could not have been anything but proper nouns. 
>此外，概括的观念只有借助于词才能输入人的心灵中，而理解概括的观念则必须通过词句。这就是禽兽之所以既不能形成这样的观念，也永远不能获得依存于这种观念的完善化能力的原因之一。当一只猴子毫不犹豫地丢下这一个核桃去摘另一个核桃时，我们能认为它具有这类果实的概括的观念并用这类果实的一般形态来和那两个个别的果实相比吗？当然不能。不过它看见这一个核桃，不免就想起它从另一个核桃所得到过的感觉；它的眼睛因为接受到一定的映象，于是预示它的味觉行将尝到一定的滋味。凡是概括的观念，都是纯理智的；稍一掺上想象，观念马上就变成个别的而不是一般的了。如果你想在头脑中描绘一棵树的一般形象，你永远描绘不成功。无论你愿意与否，你必须想象一棵树，矮小的或高大的，枝叶稀疏的或密茂的，浅色的或深色的；如果你想仅仅看到一切树木所具有的共同点，那末，你所得到的形象便不会象一棵树了。认识纯粹抽象的存在物也是一样，或者，只有通过言词才能理解它。仅仅一个三角形的定义，就可以给你关于三角形的一个真实观念，但你一在你的头脑中想象出一个三角形，那就是那样一个三角形，而不是另一个三角形了。而且你不可避免地要赋与这个三角形以可以感到的边线和带有一定颜色的图面。因此，要形成概括的观念，就必须用言词来叙述，那么，就必须说话。因为想象一停止，精神便只能借助于语言才能继续活动。那么，如果最初发明语言的人只能给他们已经具有的观念一些名称的话，则最初的名词只能是一些专门名词。

But when, by means I am unable to conceive, our new grammarians began to extend their ideas and to generalize their words, the ignorance of the inventors must have subjected this method to very strict limitations. And just as they had at first unduly multiplied the names of individual things, owing to their failure to know the genera and species, they later made too few species and genera, owing to their failure to have considered beings in all their differences. Pushing these divisions far enough would have required more experience and enlightenment than they could have had, and more investigations and work than they were willing to put into it. However, if even today new species are discovered every day that until now had escaped all our observations, just imagine how many species must have escaped the attention of men who judged things only on first appearance! As for primary classes and the most general notions, it is superfluous to add that they too must have escaped them. How, for example, would they have imagined or understood the words “matter,” “mind,” “substance,” “mode,” “figure,” and “movement,” when our philosophers, who for so long have been making use of them, have a great deal of difficulty understanding them themselves; and

### 60
when, since the ideas attached to these words are purely metaphysical, they found no model of them in nature? 
> 但是当最初的文法学家，用我所不能理解的方法，开始扩大他们的观念和概括他们的那些词的时候，创始者们的无知必然会把这种方法的应用局限于狭隘的范围；并且，起初由于他们不认识属性和种类而过多地增加了个体的名称，嗣后他们又由于不能从存在物之间所有的差别上来考察存在物，因而仅只总结出很少的属性和种类。要把分类工作进行得相当精细，就必须有比他们实际有的还要多的智慧和经验；就必须使用比他们所想使用的还要多的研究和劳力。如果直到今天，我们每天还能发现一些过去一切观察家们尚未发现的新的种类的话，试想应该有多少种类被那些只就最粗浅的外表来判断事物的人们忽略了呢！至于原始的类别和最一般的概念，不用说必然也会被他们忽略了的。比如说，他们是怎样设想或理解物质的、精神的、实体的、语气的、形象的、以及动作的等等的词呢？因为我们的哲学家使用那些词，虽然已经那末久了，他们本人理解这些词都颇有困难，而且他们赋予这些词的观念又都是纯粹形而上学的，在自然界中找不到任何模型。

I stop with these first steps, and I implore my judges to suspend their reading here to consider, concerning the invention of physical substantives alone, that is to say, concerning the easiest part of the language to discover, how far language still had to go in order to express all the thoughts of men, assume a durable form, be capable of being spoken in public, and influence society. I implore them to reflect upon how much time and knowledge were needed to discover numbers, xiv abstract words, aorists and all the tenses of verbs, particles, syntax, the connecting of sentences, reasoning, and the forming of all the logic of discourse. As for myself, being shocked by the unending difficulties and convinced of the almost demonstrable impossibility that languages could have arisen and been established by merely human means, I leave to anyone who would undertake it the discussion of the following difficult problem: which was the more necessary, an already formed society for the invention of languages, or already invented languages for the establishment of society? 
>我暂且中止我的初步探讨，请评判员们暂停阅读，仅就物质名词的创造，也就是说语言中最易发现的部分来考虑一下，语言要能够把人类一切思想都表达出来；要采取固定的形式；要能够当众讲说并对社会发生影响，还有多少路程要走呢！请你们想想，要发现数〔十四〕、抽象的词、过去时和动词的各种时态、小品词、造句法，要连接词句、要进行推理、要形成言词的全部逻辑，曾经需要多少时间和知识呢！至于我，已被越来越多的困难吓住了，我相信：语言单凭人类的智能就可以产生并建立起来几乎已被证明是不可能的事。我把这样一个难题留给愿意从事这种研究的人去讨论：当初，已经结成了的社会对于语言的建立，抑或是已经发明了的语言对于社会的建立，这二者，哪一个是最为必要呢？

Whatever these origins may be, it is clear, from the little care taken by nature to bring men together through mutual needs and to facilitate their use of speech, how little it prepared them for becoming habituated to the ways of society, and how little it contributed to all that men have done to establish the bonds of society. In fact, it is impossible to imagine why, in that primitive state, one man would have a greater need for another man than a monkey or a wolf has for another of its respective species; or, assuming this need, what motive could induce the other man to satisfy it; or even, in this latter instance, how could they be in mutual agreement regarding the conditions. I know that we are repeatedly told that nothing would have been so miserable as man in that state; and if it is true, as I believe I have proved, that it is only after many centuries that men could have had the desire and the opportunity to leave that state, that would be a charge to bring against nature, not against those whom nature has thus constituted. But if we understand the word miserable properly, it is a word that is without meaning or that signifies merely a painful privation and suffering of the body or the soul. Now I would very much like someone to explain to me: what kind of misery can there be for a free being whose heart is at peace and whose body is in good health? I ask: which of the two, civil or natural life, is more likely to become insufferable to those who live it? We see about us practically no people who do not complain about their existence; many even deprive themselves of it to the extent they are able, and the combination of divine and human laws is hardly enough to stop this disorder. I ask: has anyone ever heard of a savage who was living in liberty ever dreaming of complaining about his life and of killing himself? Let the judgment therefore be made with less pride on which side real misery lies. On the other hand, nothing would have been so miserable as savage man, dazzled by enlightenment, tormented by passions, and reasoning about a

state different from his own. It was by a very wise providence that the latent faculties he possessed should develop only as the occasion to exercise them presented itself, so that they would be neither superfluous nor troublesome to him beforehand, nor underdeveloped and useless in time of need. In instinct alone, man had everything he needed in order to live in the state of nature; in a cultivated reason, he has only what he needs to live in society.
>  无论语言和社会是怎样起源的，但从自然很少关心于使人们因相互需要而彼此接近并使人们易于使用语言这一点来看，至少可以证明自然为人准备的社会性是多么少，而在人们为建立彼此的联系所作的一切努力中，自然对人的帮助又是多么少呢！诚然，在这样的原始状态中，如果说一个人需要另一个人，比一只猴子或一只狼需要另一只猴子或另一只狼更为迫切的话，那是不可想象的事。我们即使承认这个人有那样的需要，那么，什么动机能使另一个人愿意满足他的需要呢；即使那个人愿意满足他的需要，他们彼此间又怎样能在条件上达成协议，也都是不可想象的事。我知道有人常常对我们说，没有象原始状态中的人那么悲惨的了；假如，诚然象我认为已经证明了的那样，只在若干世纪以后，人类才有脱离这种状态的愿望和机会，那我们就应当以此来控诉自然，而不应当以此来控诉自然所已造成的这样的人类。但如果我们对所谓悲惨一词有正确理解的话，它或者是一个毫无意义的词，或者不过是指一种令人难以忍受的贫困和身体上或精神上的痛苦而言；那末，我很愿意有人能够说明，一个自由的、心灵安宁身体健康的人会遭受什么样的悲惨呢？请问哪一种生活——社会的生活还是自然的生活——最易于使享受这种生活的人终于会觉得难以忍受？在我们周围，我们差不多只看见抱怨人生的人，甚至很多人情愿抛弃自己的生命，即使同时借助于神的法律和人的法律也几乎不能制止这种混乱。请问，是否有人听说过一个自由的野蛮人会抱怨人生或者想到自杀呢？那么，我们必须以较小的自尊心来判断一下真正的悲惨是在哪一面。相反地，如果野蛮人被智慧所眩惑，被情欲所困扰，总在不同于他自己所处的一种状态上去推想，那才真是再悲惨不过的。这也可以说是出于神意的一种极为明智的措施：野蛮人所有的潜在能力只能随着运用这些能力的机会而发展，以便使这些能力，既不至于因发展得过早而成为多余的负担，也不至于因发展得过迟而于必要时无济于事。野蛮人在本能中即具有生活于自然状态中所需要的一切；他只在逐渐发展起来的理性中，才具有生活于社会中所需要的东西。

At first it would seem that men in that state, having among themselves no type of moral relations or acknowledged duties, could be neither good nor evil, and had neither vices nor virtues, unless, if we take these words in a physical sense, we call those qualities that can harm an individual’s preservation “vices” in him, and those that can contribute to it “virtues.” In that case it would be necessary to call the one who least resists the simple impulses of nature the most virtuous. But without departing from the standard meaning of these words, it is appropriate to suspend the judgment we could make regarding such a situation and to be on our guard against our prejudices, until we have examined, with scales in hand, whether there are more virtues than vices among civilized men; or whether their virtues are more advantageous than their vices are lethal; or whether the progress of their knowledge is sufficient compensation for ills they inflict on one another as they learn of the good they ought to do; or whether, all things considered, they would not be in a happier set of circumstances if they had neither evil to fear nor good to hope for from anyone, rather than subjecting themselves to a universal dependence and obliging themselves to receive everything from those who do not oblige themselves to give them anything. 

> 最初，好象在自然状态中的人类，彼此间没有任何道德上的关系，也没有人所公认的义务，所以他们既不可能是善的也不可能是恶的，既无所谓邪恶也无所谓美德；除非我们从生理意义上来理解这些词，把那些在个人身上能够妨害自我保存的性质叫作邪恶，把那些能够帮助自我保存的性质叫作美德。在这种情形下，就应该把对于单纯的自然冲动最不加以抵抗的人叫作最有道德的人。但是如果我们不离开这些词的通常意义，便不应急于对这种状态作出我们可能作的判断，也不要固执己见，应当首先用天秤来衡量一下：是否在文明人中间，美德多于邪恶？或者他们的美德给他们的好处是否比他们的邪恶给他们的损害还多？或者当他们逐渐学会了彼此间所应为之善的时候，他们的知识的进步是否就足以补偿他们彼此间所作的恶？或者，总的说来，他们既不畏惧任何人对他为恶也不希求任何人对他为善，较之他们隶属于普遍依附地位，负有接受一切的义务，而另一方面对于他们则不负有给予任何东西的义务，更为幸福呢？

Above all, let us not conclude with Hobbes that because man has no idea of goodness he is naturally evil; that he is vicious because he does not know virtue; that he always refuses to perform services for his fellowmen he does not believe he owes them; or that, by virtue of the right, which he reasonably attributes to himself, to those things he needs, he foolishly imagines himself to be the sole proprietor of the entire universe. Hobbes has very clearly seen the defect of all modern definitions of natural right, but the consequences he draws from his own definition show that he takes it in a sense that is no less false. Were he to have reasoned on the basis of the principles he establishes, this author should have said that since the state of nature is the state in which the concern for our self-preservation is the least prejudicial to that of others, that state was consequently the most appropriate for peace and the best suited for the human race. He says precisely the opposite, because he had wrongly injected into the savage man’s concern for self-preservation the need to satisfy a multitude of passions that are the product of society and have made laws necessary. The evil man, he says, is a robust child. [39] It remains to be seen whether savage man is a robust child. Were we to grant him this, what would we conclude from it? That if this man were as dependent on others when he is 

>39 [Hobbes, De Cive, ch. 10, §1, and, here, Praefatio ad lectores. ]

### 62
robust as he is when he is weak, there is no type of excess to which he would not tend: he would beat his mother, were she too slow in offering him her breast; he would strangle one of his younger brothers, should he find him annoying; he would bite someone’s leg, should he be assaulted or aggravated by him. But being robust and being dependent are two contradictory suppositions in the state of nature. Man is weak when he is dependent, and he is emancipated from that dependence before he is robust. Hobbes did not see that the same cause that prevents savages from using their reason, despite what our jurists think, is what prevents them at the same time from abusing their physical capacities, despite what he himself thinks. Hence we could say that savages are not evil precisely because they do not know what it is to be good; for it is neither the development of enlightenment nor the restraint imposed by the law, but the calm of their passions and their ignorance of vice that prevents them from doing evil. “So much more profitable to these is the ignorance of vice than the knowledge of virtue is to those.”[40] Moreover, there is another principle that Hobbes failed to notice, and that, having been given to man in order to mitigate, in certain circumstances, the ferocity of his egocentrism [ amour propre ] or the desire for self-preservation before this egocentrism of his came into being, xv tempers the ardor he has for his own well-being by an innate repugnance to seeing his fellowmen suffer. I do not believe I have any contradiction to fear in granting to man the only natural virtue that the most excessive detractor of human virtues was forced to recognize.[41] I am referring to pity, a disposition that is fitting for beings that are as weak and as subject to ills as we are; a virtue all the more universal and all the more useful to man in that it precedes in him any kind of reflection, and so natural that even animals sometimes show noticeable signs of it. Without speaking of the tenderness of mothers for their young and of the perils they have to brave in order to protect them, one daily observes the repugnance that horses have for trampling a living body with their hooves. An animal does not go undisturbed past a dead animal of its own species. There are even some animals that give them a kind of tomb; and the mournful lowing of cattle entering a slaughterhouse voices the impression they receive of the horrible spectacle that strikes them. One notes with pleasure the author of The Fable of the Bees, having been forced to acknowledge man as a compassionate and sensitive being, departing from his cold and subtle style in the example he gives, to offer us the pathetic image of an imprisoned man who sees outside his cell a ferocious animal tearing a child from its mother’s breast, mashing its frail limbs with its murderous teeth, and ripping with its claws the child’s quivering entrails. What horrible agitation must be felt by this witness of an event in which he has no personal interest! What anguish must he suffer

>我们尤其不可象霍布斯那样作出结论说：人天生是恶的，因为他没有任何善的观念；人是邪恶的，因为他不知美德为何物；人从不肯为同类服务，因为他不认为对同类负有这种义务。我们也不可象霍布斯那样下结论说：人根据他对于所需之物有正当要求的权利，便疯狂地把自己看作是整个宇宙的唯一所有主。霍布斯虽然很清楚地看出所有关于自然法的现代定义的缺点，但是他从自己的定义中所推出的那些结论适足以说明，他对这一定义的理解也同样是错误的。这位作者，在根据他所建立的原则进行推理的时候，本应当这样说：由于自然状态是每一个人对于自我保存的关心最不妨害他人自我保存的一种状态，所以这种状态最能保持和平，对于人类也是最为适宜的。可是他所说的恰恰与此相反，因为他把满足无数欲望的需要，不适当地掺入野蛮人对自我保存的关心中，其实这些欲望乃是社会的产物，正因为有这些欲望才使法律成为必要的。霍布斯说：恶人是一个强壮的幼儿。我们还须进一步了解，野蛮人是不是一个强壮的幼儿。如果我们承认野蛮人是一个强壮的幼儿，就会得出什么结论呢？假如这个人，当他是强壮的时候，也象他软弱的时候那样，需要依赖于人，那末就没有一件蛮横的事情他作不出来的：他会因母亲未及时哺乳而打她，会因弟弟讨厌而虐待他，会因别人碰撞了他或搅扰了他而咬别人的腿。但是，一个人是强壮的而同时又须依赖于人，这乃是自然状态中两个相互矛盾的假设。当一个人依赖于人的时候，他是软弱的；在他变得强壮以前，他已经是一个独立自主的人了。霍布斯没有看到：我们的法学家们所主张的阻止野蛮人使用他们自己的理性的原因，恰恰也就是霍布斯自己所主张的阻止野蛮人滥用他们自己的能力的原因。因此，我们可以说，野蛮人所以不是恶的，正因为他们不知道什么是善。因为阻止他们作恶的，不是智慧的发展，也不是法律的约束，而是情感的平静和对邪恶的无知：“这些人因对邪恶的无知而得到的好处比那些人因对美德的认识而得到的好处还要大些”。而且另外还有一个原理，是霍布斯没有看到的：由于人类看见自己的同类受苦天生就有一种反感，从而使他为自己谋幸福的热情受到限制。由于这一来自人类天性的原理，所以人类在某些情形下，缓和了他的强烈的自尊心、或者在这种自尊心〔十五〕未产生以前，缓和了他的自爱心。我所认为人类具有这种唯一的自然美德，就是对人类美德最激烈的毁谤者也不得不承认，因此，我不相信会有任何非难之可怕。我所说的怜悯心，对于象我们这样软弱并易于受到那么多灾难的生物来说确实是一种颇为适宜的禀性；也是人类最普遍、最有益的一种美德，尤其是因为怜悯心在人类能运用任何思考以前就存在着，又是那样自然，即使禽兽有时也会显露出一些迹象。姑不谈母兽对幼兽的温柔，和它们为保护幼兽的生命而冒的危险，此外，我们每天都还可以看到，马也不愿意践踏一个活的东西。一个动物从它同类的尸体近旁走过时，总是很不安的。有些动物甚至还会把它们已死的同类作某种方式的埋葬；而每一个牲畜走进屠宰场时发出的哀鸣，说明对于使它受到刺激的可怕的景象也有一种感触。我们欣然看到“蜜蜂寓言”的作者也不得不承认人是容易受感动而有同情心的生物。他改变了他那一向冷隽而细致的文笔，在他所举的例子中给我们呈现出一个动人的情景。他描写了一个被幽禁的人，望见外面一只猛兽，从母亲怀抱里夺去了一个幼儿。在它的伤人的利齿间，咬碎了那个脆弱的肢体，用它的爪子撕开了那个尚在跳动着的脏腑。这个人亲眼看到的虽然是与他个人毫不相干的事情，但是却使他如何惊心动魄！目睹这种悲惨景象，对于昏了过去的母亲和垂死的婴儿都不能予以援救，他又是如何焦急不安！

Such is the pure movement of nature prior to all reflection. Such is the force of natural pity, which the most depraved mores still have difficulty destroying, since every day one sees in our theaters someone affected and weeping at the ills of some unfortunate person, and who, were he in the tyrant’s place, would intensify the torments of his enemy still more; like the bloodthirsty Sulla, so sensitive to ills he had not caused, or like Alexander of Pherae, who did not dare attend the performance of any tragedy, for fear of being seen weeping with Andromache and Priam, and yet who listened impassively to the cries of so many citizens who were killed every day on his orders. “Nature, in giving men tears, bears witness that it gave the human race the softest hearts."[43] Mandeville has a clear awareness that, with all their mores, men would never have been anything but monsters, if nature had not given them pity to aid their reason; but he has not seen that from this quality alone flow all the social virtues that he wants to deny in men. In fact, what are generosity, mercy, and humanity, if not pity applied to the weak, to the guilty, or to the human species in general? Benevolence and even friendship are, properly understood, the products of a constant pity fixed on a particular object; for is desiring that someone not suffer anything but desiring that he be happy? Were it true that commiseration were merely a sentiment that puts us in the position of the one who suffers, a sentiment that is obscure and powerful in savage man, developed but weak in man dwelling in civil society, what importance would this idea have to the truth of what I say, except to give it more force? In fact, commiseration will be all the more energetic as the witnessing animal identifies itself more intimately with the suffering animal. Now it is evident that this identification must have been infinitely closer in the state of nature than in the state of reasoning. Reason is what engenders egocentrism [ amour propre ], and reflection strengthens it. Reason is what turns man in upon himself. Reason is what separates him from all that troubles him and afflicts him. Philosophy is what isolates him and moves him to say in secret, at the sight of a suffering man, “Perish if you will; I am safe and sound.” No longer can anything but danger to the entire society trouble the tranquil slumber of the philosopher and yank him from his bed. His fellowman can be killed with impunity underneath his window. He has merely to place his hands over his ears and argue with himself a little in order to prevent nature, which rebels within him, from identifying him with the man being assassinated. [44] Savage man does not have this admirable talent, and for lack of wisdom and reason he is always seen thoughtlessly giving in to the first sentiment of humanity. When there is a riot or a street brawl, the

>先于一切思考而存在的纯自然的感动就是这样；自然的怜悯心的力量就是这样，即使最坏的风俗也不能把它们毁灭。在剧院中，我们天天可以看到一些人对于剧中不幸者的悲惨遭遇，在那里伤心落泪，其实倘若这些人自己作了暴君，还会加重对他们的敌人的虐待。正如嗜杀的苏拉，对于不是由他自己所造成的痛苦，也非常伤感；又如菲尔王亚历山大不敢去看任何悲剧的演出，怕人们会看见他和昂朵马克和普里亚莫一同叹息，但当他听到每天因执行他的命令而被处死的那么多人的呼号时，却丝毫无动于衷。“自然既把眼泪赋与人类，就表示出：它曾赐与人类一颗最仁慈的心。”曼德维尔已经感觉到，如果自然不曾赋与人们以怜悯心作为理性的支柱，则人们尽管具有一切的道德，也不过是一些怪物而已；但曼德维尔没有看到，人们所能具有而为他所否认的一切社会美德正是从怜悯心这种性质中产生出来的。其实，除了对弱者、罪人、或对整个人类所怀有的怜悯心外，还有什么可以称为仁慈、宽大和人道呢？即所谓关怀、友谊，如果正确地去理解，也无非是固定于某一特定对象上的持久的怜惘心的产物；因为希望一个人不受任何痛苦，不是希望他幸福还是什么呢？即使怜悯心实际上也不过是使我们设身处地与受苦者起共鸣的一种情感（这种情感，在野蛮人身上虽不显著，却是很强烈的，在文明人身上虽然发达，但却是微弱的），这种说法，除了更足以论证我所持的论点外，还有什么其他意义呢？事实上，旁观的动物对受苦的动物所起的共鸣越深切，怜悯心就越强烈。那末，十分明显，这种共鸣，在自然状态中比在推理状态中，当然是更深切得不止几千万倍。产生自尊心的是理性，而加强自尊心的则是思考。理性使人敛翼自保，远离一切对他有妨碍和使他痛苦的东西。哲学使人与世隔绝，正是由于哲学，人才会在一个受难者的面前暗暗地说：“你要死就死吧，反正我很安全”。只有整个社会的危险，才能搅扰哲学家的清梦，把他从床上拖起。人们可以肆无忌惮地在他窗下杀害他的同类，他只把双手掩住耳朵替自己稍微辩解一下，就可以阻止由于天性而在他内心激发起来的对被害者的同情。野蛮人绝没有这种惊人的本领，由于缺乏智慧和理性，他总是丝毫不加思索地服从于人类的原始感情。当发生骚乱时，或当街头发生争吵时，贱民们蜂拥而至，谨慎的人们则匆匆走避；把厮打着的人劝开，阻止上流人互相伤害的正是群氓，正是市井妇女。

It is therefore quite certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in each individual the activity of the love of oneself, contributes to the mutual preservation of the entire species. Pity is what carries us without reflection to the aid of those we see suffering. Pity is what, in the state of nature, takes the place of laws, mores, and virtue, with the advantage that no one is tempted to disobey its sweet voice. Pity is what will prevent every robust savage from robbing a weak child or an infirm old man of his hard-earned subsistence, if he himself expects to be able to find his own someplace else. Instead of the sublime maxim of reasoned justice, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, pity inspires all men with another maxim of natural goodness, much less perfect but perhaps more useful than the preceding one: Do what is good for you with as little harm as possible to others. In a word, it is in this natural sentiment rather than in subtle arguments that one must search for the cause of the repugnance at doing evil that every man would experience, even independently of the maxims of education. Although it might be appropriate for Socrates and minds of his stature to acquire virtue through reason, the human race would long ago have ceased to exist, if its preservation had depended solely on the reasonings of its members.
>因此我们可以肯定地说，怜悯心是一种自然的情感，由于它调节着每一个人自爱心的活动，所以对于人类全体的相互保存起着协助作用。正是这种情感，使我们不加思索地去援救我们所见到的受苦的人。正是这种情感，在自然状态中代替着法律、风俗和道德，而且这种情感还有一个优点，就是没有一个人企图抗拒它那温柔的声音。正是这种情感使得一切健壮的野蛮人，只要有希望在别处找到生活资料，绝不去掠夺幼弱的小孩或衰弱的老人艰难得来的东西。正是这种情感不以“你要人怎样待你，你就怎样待人”这句富有理性正义的崇高格言，而以另一句合乎善良天性的格言：“你为自己谋利益要尽可能地少损害别人”来启示所有的人。后一句格言远不如前一句完善，但也许更为有用。总之，我们与其在那些微妙的论证中，不如在这种自然情感中，去探求任何一个人在作恶时，即使他对于教育的格言一无所知，也会感到内疚的原因。虽然苏格拉底和具有他那种素质的人能够通过理性获得美德，但如果人类的保存仅仅依赖于人们的推理，则人类也许久已不复存在。 

With passions so minimally active and with such a salutary restraint, being more wild than evil, and more attentive to protecting themselves from the harm they could receive than tempted to do harm to others, men were not subject to very dangerous conflicts. Since they had no sort of intercourse among themselves; since, as a consequence, they knew neither vanity, nor deference, nor esteem, nor contempt; since they had not the slightest notion of mine and thine, nor any true idea of justice; since they regarded the acts of violence that could befall them as an easily redressed evil and not as an offense that must be punished; and since they did not even dream of vengeance except perhaps as a knee-jerk response right then and there, like the dog that bites the stone that is thrown at it, their disputes would rarely have had bloody consequences, if their subject had been no more sensitive than food. But I see a more dangerous matter that remains for me to discuss.
>原始人的情欲是那样的不强烈，同时又受到怜悯心如此有益的约束，所以与其说原始人是邪恶的，勿宁说他们是粗野的；与其说他们有意加害于人，不如说他们更注意防范可能遭到的侵害，因此在原始人之间不易发生十分危险的争执。因为他们之间没有任何种类的交往，所以他们不知道什么叫作虚荣、尊崇、重视和轻蔑；他们丝毫没有“你的”和“我的”这种概念；也没有任何真正的公正观念；他们把可能遭受的暴行视为是一种易于弥补的损害，而不认为是一种应予惩罚的侮辱。他们甚至连报复的念头都没有，除非有时象狗吞咬向它投掷的石头一样，机械地立刻表示反抗。由于以上原因，他们的争执的对象，如果不比食物更令人动心的话，他们的争执很少会发生流血的后果。但是，其中有一种比较危险的争端，还须加以说明。

Among the passions that agitate the heart of man, there is an ardent, impetuous one that renders one sex necessary to the other; a terrible passion that braves all dangers, overcomes all obstacles, and that, in its fury, seems fitted to destroy the human race it is destined to preserve. What would become of men, victimized by this unrestrained and brutal rage, without modesty and self-control, fighting every day over the object of their passion at the price of their blood?
> 在激动人心的各种情欲中，使男女需要异性的那种情欲，是最炽热也是最激烈的。这种可怕的情欲能使人不顾一切危险，冲破一切障碍。当它达到疯狂程度的时候，仿佛足以毁灭人类，而它所负的天然使命本是为了保存人类的。如果人们作了这种热狂的、残暴的、不知羞耻、毫无节制的情欲的俘虏，每天不惜流血互相争夺他们所爱的对象，他们将会变成什么样子呢？

There must first be agreement that the more violent the passions are, the more necessary the laws are to contain them. But over and above the fact that the disorders and the crimes, caused daily in our midst by these passions,

### 65
show quite well the insufficiency of the laws in this regard, it would still be good to examine whether these disorders did not come into being with the laws themselves; for then, even if they were capable of repressing them, still the least one would expect of them would be that they call a halt to an evil that would not exist without them. 
>我们首先应该承认，情欲越强烈，便越需要法律的约束。但是，这种情欲每天在我们当中所引起的混乱和所造成的罪恶已足以证明法律在这方面力量的薄弱。此外，我们还应当进一步考察这种混乱是否伴随着法律本身一起产生的。因为，在这种情形下，即使法律能够制止这种混乱，但是，如果我们要求法律来制止没有法律根本就不会存在的祸害，那未免是向法律提出最无意义的一种要求。

Let us begin by distinguishing between the moral and the physical aspects of the sentiment of love. The physical aspect is that general desire that inclines one sex to unite with another. The moral aspect is what determines this desire and fixes it exclusively on one single object, or which at least gives it a greater degree of energy for this preferred object. Now it is easy to see that the moral aspect of love is an artificial sentiment born of social custom, and extolled by women with so much skill and care in order to establish their hegemony and make dominant the sex that ought to obey.[45] Since this feeling is founded on certain notions of merit or beauty that a savage is not in a position to have, and on comparisons he is incapable of making, it must be almost nonexistent for him. For since his mind could not form abstract ideas of regularity and proportion, his heart is not susceptible to sentiments of admiration and love, which, even without their being observed, come into being from the application of these ideas. He pays exclusive attention to the sexual appetite[46] he has received from nature, and none to the taste he has been unable to acquire; any woman suits his purpose. 
>让我们首先把“爱”这种情感的精神方面与生理方面加以区分。生理方面的爱是人人所具有的和异性结合的欲望。精神方面的爱，则是把这种欲望确定起来，把它完全固定在唯一对象上，或者至少是以比较强烈的欲望来特别喜爱某一对象。因此，很容易看出，精神方面的爱，不过是由社会习惯产生出来的一种人为的情感。妇女们对它尽颂扬之能事，以便建立她们的权威，使本来应该服从的女性处于统治地位。这种情感建立在才德和美丽等一类的观念和种种的比较上；野蛮人不会有那些观念，也决不会作那些比较，所以这种情感对野蛮人来说几乎是不存在的。因为在野蛮人的思想里，不会构成匀称与调和等等抽象观念，所以在他的心里也不会有什么赞赏和爱慕的情感；这些情感尽管人们不自觉察，总是从这些观念的运用中产生出来的。野蛮人仅只听从天然气质的支配，而并不听从他尚未能获得的爱好的支配；任何女人，对他说来，都是同样合适的。

Limited merely to the physical aspect of love, and fortunate enough to be ignorant of those preferences that stir up the feeling and increase the difficulties in satisfying it, men must feel the ardors of their sexual appetite less frequently and less vividly, and consequently have fewer and less cruel conflicts among themselves. Imagination, which wreaks so much havoc among us, does not speak to savage hearts; each man peacefully awaits the impetus of nature, gives himself over to it without choice, and with more pleasure than frenzy; and once the need is satisfied, all desire is snuffed out. 
>仅仅局限于生理方面的爱的野蛮人，是相当幸福的，他们对于能以激起爱的情感并增加其困难的那种偏爱一无所知，所以他们的感情冲动不会太频繁、太激烈，他们之间的争执因而也较少，而且也不那么残酷。在我们之间造成无数烦扰的那种意念，是不会侵袭野蛮人的心灵的。每个野蛮人只是静候着自然的冲动，当他服从这种冲动的时候，对于对象并无所选择，他的心情与其说是狂热的，不如说是愉快的；需要一经满足，欲望便完全消失了。

Hence it is incontestable that love itself, like all the other passions, has acquired only in society that impetuous ardor that so often makes it lethal to men. And it is all the more ridiculous to represent savages as continually slaughtering each other in order to satisfy their brutality, since this opinion is directly contrary to experience; and since the Caribs, who, of all existing peoples, are the people that until now has wandered least from the state of nature, are precisely the people least subject to jealousy, even though they 

>45 [Voltaire, who believed that men and women are equal, wrote in the margin of his copy one word: “why?”] 

>46 [Rousseau’s word is tempérament. The 1762 edition of the Dictionnaire de l’Académie française says, “On dit absolument, Avoir du tempérament, pour dire, Être fort porté à l’amour” (to have a very powerful sex drive).]

### 66
live in a hot climate, which always seems to make these passions all the more forceful. 
>所以，爱情也和其他一切情欲一样，只是在社会中才达到了时常给人带来灾难的那种狂热程度，这是一个无可争辩的事实。此外，如果我们认为野蛮人为了满足兽性，而不断地相互残害，那是很荒谬的，因为这种想法与实验正相反。例如加拉伊波人是所有现存民族中，迄今最接近于自然状态的一个民族，尽管他们生活在炎热地带，按气候对他们的影响来说，他们的情欲应当是很强烈的，但他们在爱情生活上却是最安宁的，很少因嫉妒而引起纠纷。

As to any inferences that could be drawn, in the case of several species of animals, from the clashes between males that bloody our poultry yards throughout the year, and which make our forests resound in the spring with the cries of the males as they quarrel over a female, it is necessary to begin by excluding all species in which nature has manifestly established, in the relative power of the sexes, relations other than those that exist among us. Hence cockfights do not form the basis for an inference regarding the human species. In species where the difference between males and females is less marked, these fights can have for their cause only the scarcity of females in relation to the number of males, or the limited periods of time during which the female continually rejects the advances of the male, which amounts to the same thing. For if each female receives the male for only two months a year, in this respect it is as if the number of females were reduced by five-sixths. Now neither of these two cases is applicable to the human species, where the number of females generally surpasses the number of males, and where human females, unlike those of other species, have never been observed to have periods of heat and exclusion, even among savages. Moreover, among several of these animal species, where the entire species goes into heat simultaneously, there comes a terrible moment of common ardor, tumult, disorder, and combat: a moment that does not happen in the human species, where love is never seasonal. Therefore one cannot conclude from the combats of certain animals for the possession of females that the same thing would happen to man in the state of nature. And even if one could draw that conclusion, given that these conflicts do not destroy the other species, one should conclude that they would not be any more lethal for ours. And it is quite apparent that they would wreak less havoc in the state of nature than in society, especially in countries where mores still count for something and where the jealousy of lovers and the vengeance of husbands every day give rise to duels, murders, and still worse things; where the duty of eternal fidelity serves merely to create adulterers; and where even the laws of continence and honor inevitably spread debauchery and multiply the number of abortions. 
>在许多种类的动物中，由于雄性争夺雌性而发生的争斗，往往使我们的养禽场涂上血迹；或者在春天的树林里因吵闹的叫声而发出回响，关于从这种现象中所能作出的那些推论，我们首先应当排除所有这些种类的动物，因为自然对于这些种类的动物，在雌雄之间显然规定了与人类有所不同的两性能力的对比关系。因此，我们不能从雄鸡相斗作出适用于人类的推论。在对这种对比关系观察得比较确切的动物中，造成雄性相斗的原因，不外是由于雌雄两性数目的对比，雌性较少，或者是由于雌性有经常拒绝雄性接近的期间。后一个原因终于要归结为前一个原因，因为假使每个雌性每年与雄性接近的期间只有两个月，结果就等于雌性数目减少了六分之五。然而，这两种情形，没有任何一种可以适用于人类。在人类中，女性数目通常总是超过男性，即在野蛮人当中，我们也从来不曾见过女性象别种动物那样，有性的需要期和排拒期。此外，在上述那些动物的若干种类中，往往整个种类同时进入发情期，于是有一个可怕的普遍狂热、叫嚣、混乱和争斗的时刻来临。这种时刻在人类中决不会发生，因为人类的性欲并没有周期性。所以我们不能由某些动物因争夺雌性而进行的争斗，来推定自然状态中的人类也会发生同样的情形。即便我们能够做出这样的推断，而这种争斗既没有使其他动物同归于尽，我们至少可以设想，它对于人类也不会是更为不幸的。而且，显而易见，这类争斗在自然状态中所造成的祸害，比在社会状态中所造成的祸害要少得多，尤其是比在道德尚被重视的国家中要少得多。在这些国家里，情人的嫉妒和配偶的报仇，每天都会引起决斗、杀害或其他更为悲惨的事情。夫妻间永久忠实的义务，只会促成通奸行为，而那些关于贞操和荣誉的法律本身，则必然会助长淫乱之风，增加堕胎事件。

Let us conclude that, wandering in the forests, without skills, without speech, without dwelling, without war, without relationships, with no need for his fellowmen, and correspondingly with no desire to do them harm, perhaps never even recognizing any of them individually, savage man, subject to few passions and self-sufficient, had only the sentiments and enlightenment appropriate to that state; he felt only his true needs, took notice of only what he believed he had an interest in seeing; and his intelligence was no more developed than his vanity. If by chance he made some discovery, he was all the less able to communicate it to others because he did not even know his own children. Art perished with its inventor. There was neither education nor progress; generations were multiplied to no purpose. Since each one always

### 67
began from the same point, centuries went by with all the crudeness of the first ages; the species was already old, and man remained ever a child. 
>我们可以作出这样的结论：漂泊于森林中的野蛮人，没有农工业、没有语言、没有住所、没有战争、彼此间也没有任何联系，他对于同类既无所需求，也无加害意图，甚至也许从来不能辨认他同类中的任何人。这样的野蛮人不会有多少情欲，只过着无求于人的孤独生活，所以他仅有适合于这种状态的感情和知识。他所感觉到的只限于自己的真正需要，所注意的只限于他认为迫切需要注意的东西，而且他的智慧并不比他的幻想有更多的发展。即使他偶尔有所发明，也不能把这种发明传授给别人，因为他连自己的子女都不认识。技术随着发明者的死亡而消灭。在这种状态中，既无所谓教育，也无所谓进步，一代一代毫无进益地繁衍下去，每一代都从同样的起点开始。许多世纪都在原始时代的极其粗野的状态中度了过去；人类已经古老了，但人始终还是幼稚的。

If I have gone on at such length about this hypothetical primitive condition, it is because, having ancient errors and inveterate prejudices to destroy, I felt I should dig down to the root and show, through the depiction of the true state of nature, how far even natural inequality is from having as much reality and influence in that state as our writers claim. 
>我所以费了很多笔墨来阐述我所设想的原始状态，是因为在这一问题上有许多由来已久的错误观念和根深蒂固的成见应当消除。因此，我认为必须追本溯源从真实自然状态的描绘中证明：即使是自然的不平等，在这种状态中，也不象近代学者所主张的那样真实和那样有影响。

In fact, it is easy to see that, among the differences that distinguish men, several of them pass for natural ones that are exclusively the work of habit and of the various sorts of life that men adopt in society. Thus a robust or delicate temperament, and the strength or weakness that depend on it, frequently derive more from the harsh or effeminate way in which one has been raised than from the primitive constitution of one’s body. The same holds for mental powers; and not only does education make a difference between cultivated minds and those that are not, it also augments the difference among the former in proportion to their culture; for were a giant and a dwarf walking on the same road, each step they both took would give a fresh advantage to the giant. Now if one compares the prodigious diversity of educations and lifestyles to be found in the different orders of the civil state[47] with the simplicity and uniformity of animal and savage life, where all nourish themselves from the same foods, live in the same manner, and do exactly the same things, it will be understood how much less the difference between one man and another must be in the state of nature than in that of society, and how much natural inequality must increase in the human species through inequality occasioned by social institutions. 
>实际上，我们很容易理解，在那些区分人与人之间的各种差别中，有许多被认为是天然的差别，其实这些差别完全是习惯和人们在社会中所采取的各种不同的生活方式的产物。因此，一个人体质的强弱以及依存于体质的体力的大小，往往取决于他是在艰苦环境中成长起来的，抑或是在娇生惯养中成长起来的，而不是取决于他的身体的先天禀赋。智力的强弱，也是一样。教育不仅能在受过教育的人和没受过教育的人之间造成差别，而且还随着所受教育程度的不同而增大存在于前者之间的差别。因为一个巨人和一个矮人，在同一道路上行走，二人每走一步，彼此之间的距离必更为增大。假如我们把流行于文明社会各种不同等级之中的教育和生活方式上的不可思议的多样性，来和吃同样食物，过同样生活，行动完全一样的动物和野蛮人的生活的单纯一致比较一下，便会了解人与人之间在自然状态中的差别，应当是如何小于在社会状态中的差别，同时也会了解，自然的不平等在人类中是如何由于人为的不平等而加深了。

But even if nature were to display, in the distribution of its gifts, as many preferences as is claimed, what advantage would the most favored men derive from them, to the detriment of others, in a state of things that allowed practically no sort of relationships among them? Where there is no love, what use is beauty? What use is wit for people who do not speak, and cunning for those who have no dealing with others? I always hear it repeated that the stronger will oppress the weaker. But let me have an explanation of the meaning of the word “oppression.” Some will dominate with violence; others will groan, enslaved to their every whim— well, that is precisely what I observe among us, but I do not see how this could be said of savage men, to whom it would be difficult even to explain what servitude and domination are. A man could well lay hold of the fruit another has gathered, the game he has killed, the cave that served as his shelter. But how will he ever succeed in making himself be obeyed? And what can be the chains of dependence among men who possess nothing? If someone chases me from one tree, I am free to go to another; if someone torments me in one place, who will prevent me from 

>47 [Rousseau’s phrase is les différents ordres de l’état civil . One might almost translate it as “the social classes of civilized society.”]

### 68
going elsewhere? Is there a man with strength sufficiently superior to mine and who is, moreover, sufficiently depraved, sufficiently lazy, and sufficiently ferocious to force me to provide for his subsistence while he remains idle? He must resolve not to take his eyes off me for a single instant, to keep me carefully tied down while he sleeps, for fear that I may escape or that I would kill him. In other words, he is obliged to expose himself voluntarily to a much greater hardship than the one he wants to avoid and gives me. After all that, were his vigilance to relax for an instant, were an unforeseen noise to make him turn his head, I take twenty steps into the forest; my chains are broken, and he never sees me again for the rest of his life. 
>自然在给人分配天赋时，即使真地象人们所说，往往厚此而薄彼，但是在人与人之间几乎不可能发生任何关系的环境中，那些得天独厚的人们，因受到自然偏爱而获得的好处，对于别人又有什么损害呢？在没有爱情的地方，美丽有什么用呢？对于没有语言的人，才智有什么用呢？对于不互通交易的人，狡诈有什么用呢？我经常听人说，强者压迫弱者，但是我希望有人能够向我说明压迫这个词的涵义是什么。一些人使用暴力来统治另一些人，后者呻吟于前者为所欲为的奴役之下，这正是在我们之间我所观察到的情形；但是我不理解如何能据此推断野蛮人也是这样，因为甚至使他们了解什么是奴役和统治都颇有困难。一个人很可能夺取别人摘到的果实，打死的禽兽，或者侵占别人用作躲蔽风雨的洞穴；但他怎样能够作到强使别人服从他呢？在一无所有的人们之间从属关系的锁链究竟是怎样形成的呢？如果有人要从一颗树上把我赶走，我可以离开这颗树到另一颗树上去；如果在某一个地方有人搅扰我，谁会阻挡我到别处去呢？有没有这样一个人，因为他不但力量比我大，而且还相当腐化、懒惰、凶恶，竟至强迫我替他觅取食物，而他自己却无所事事呢？那么，这个人就必须下定决心时时刻刻注意着我，在他要睡觉的时候，还得十分小心地把我捆绑起来，免得我会逃掉，或者把他杀死，也就是说，他必须甘愿给自己增加一种负担，而这种负担远比他自己想避免的和他所加给我的还要大得多。除此之外，他的戒备会不会稍微松懈一下呢？一个意外的声音会不会使他回一下头呢？我走进树林二十步远，我的束缚就解除了，他一生再也不会看见我了。

Without needlessly prolonging these details, anyone should see that, since the bonds of servitude are formed merely from the mutual dependence of men and the reciprocal needs that unite them, it is impossible to enslave a man without having first put him in the position of being incapable of doing without another. This being a situation that did not exist in the state of nature, it leaves each person free of the yoke, and renders pointless the law of the strongest. 
>这些细节，无须再加以赘述。每个人都会理解，奴役的关系，只是由人们的相互依赖和使人们结合起来的种种相互需要形成的。因此，如不先使一个人陷于不能脱离另一个人而生活的状态，便不可能奴役这个人。这种情形在自然状态中是不存在的。在那种状态中，每个人都不受任何束缚，最强者的权力也不发生作用。

After having proved that inequality is hardly observable in the state of nature, and that its influence there is almost nonexistent, it remains for me to show its origin and progress in the successive developments of the human mind. After having shown that perfectibility, social virtues, and the other faculties that natural man had received in a state of potentiality could never develop by themselves, that to achieve this development they required the chance coming together of several unconnected causes that might never have come into being and without which he would have remained eternally in his primitive condition , it remains for me to consider and to bring together the various chance happenings that were able to perfect human reason while deteriorating the species, make a being evil while rendering it habituated to the ways of society, and, from so distant a beginning, finally bring man and the world to the point where we see them now. 
>我既已证明了不平等在自然状态中几乎是人们感觉不到的，它的影响也几乎是等于零的。我还应进一步指出在人类智慧连续发展中不平等的起源和进展。我已经指明完善化能力、社会美德、以及自然人所能禀受的其他各种潜在能力，绝不能自己发展起来，而必须借助于许多外部原因的偶然会合。但是，这些原因可能永不发生，而没有这些原因，自然人则会永远停留在他的原始状态。所以，我还应把各种不同的偶然事件加以观察和归纳，这些偶然事件曾经使人的理性趋于完善，同时却使整个人类败坏下去。在使人成为社会的人的同时，却使人变成了邪恶的生物，并把人和世界从那末遥远的一个时代，终于引到了今天这个地步。

I admit that, since the events I have to describe could have taken place in several ways, I cannot make a determination among them except on the basis of conjecture. But over and above the fact that these conjectures become reasons when they are the most probable ones that a person can draw from the nature of things and the sole means that a person can have of discovering the truth, the consequences I wish to deduce from mine will not thereby be at all conjectural, since, on the basis of the principles I have just established, no other system is conceivable that would not furnish me with the same results, and from which I could not draw the same conclusions. 
>我承认，因为我要叙述的事件可能是在种种情形下发生的，所以我只能通过一些猜测来决定我的选择。但是，这些猜测，当它们是从事物本性中所能作出最接近于真实的猜测时；当它们是我们用以发现真理所能有的唯一方法时，便转化为推理的依据。此外，我所要从我的猜测中推出的结论，也不会因此便成为猜测性的结论，因为依据我以上所建立的那些原理，人们不能建立其他任何学说，其他任何学说不能给我提供同样的结果，也不能使我得出同样的结论。

This will excuse me from expanding my reflections on the way in which the lapse of time compensates for the slight probability of events; on the surprising power that quite negligible causes may have when they act without interruption; on the impossibility, on the one hand, of our being able

### 69
to disprove certain hypotheses, even though, on the other hand, we are in a position to accord them the level of certitude that would justify regarding them as facts. Note that in a situation in which two facts have been acknowledged as real, but need to be connected by a series of intermediate facts that are unknown or regarded as such, it belongs to history, where it exists, to provide the facts that connect them; but it belongs to philosophy, where history is unavailable, to determine what sort of facts could connect them. Finally, bear in mind that, with respect to events, similarity reduces the facts to a much smaller number of different classes than one might imagine. It is enough for me to submit these topics to the consideration of my judges; it is enough for me to have seen to it that ordinary readers should have no need to consider them. 
>这样就使我对于以下各点无须再深入思考：时间的经过如何弥补了各种事件所欠缺的真实性；一些轻微的原因，当它们继续不断发生作用时会成为惊人的力量；某些假定，一方面我们虽然不能给以与事实相等的确实性，但另一方面我们要想推翻也是不可能的；两件被认为真实的事实，是由一系列未知的或被认为未知的中介事实联系起来的，如有历史可寻，应由历史来提供那些起联系作用的事实，如无历史可考，则应由哲学来确定那些能起联系作用的类似的事实；最后，就变故而言，事物之间的类似性已使各种事实在类别上简化为比我们所想象的还要少得多的数目。我只把这些问题呈献给我的评判员们去研究，并作到使一般读者无须再加以考虑也就够了。

## PART TWO 

The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it into his head to say, “This is mine,” and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society. What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race have been spared, had someone pulled up the stakes or filled in the ditch and cried out to his fellowmen, “Do not listen to this impostor. You are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to all and the earth to no one!”? But it is quite likely that by then things had already reached the point where they could no longer continue as they were. For this idea of property, depending on many prior ideas that could only have arisen successively, was not formed all at once in the human mind. It was necessary to make great progress, acquire many skills and much enlightenment, and transmit and augment them from one age to another before arriving at this final limit to the state of nature. Let us therefore go back to an earlier point and try to piece together from a single point of view that slow succession of events and advances in knowledge, taking them in their most natural order. 
>谁第一个把一块土地圈起来并想到说：这是我的，而且找到一些头脑十分简单的人居然相信了他的话，谁就是文明社会的真正奠基者。假如有人拔掉木桩或者填平沟壕，并向他的同类大声疾呼：“不要听信这个骗子的话，如果你们忘记土地的果实是大家所有的，土地是不属于任何人的，那你们就要遭殃了！”这个人该会使人类免去多少罪行、战争和杀害，免去多少苦难和恐怖啊！但是，很明显，那时一切事物已经发展到不能再象以前那样继续下去的地步了。因为这种私有观念不是一下子在人类思想中形成的，它是由许多只能陆续产生的先行观念演变而来的。人类在达到自然状态的终点以前，需要已经有了很大的进步，获得很多的技巧和知识，并把这些技巧和知识一代一代地传授下去，使它们不断增加起来。因此，我们不得不追溯到更为遥远的时代，竭力用同一观点，按照最自然的顺序，把那些缓慢递嬗的事件和陆续获得的知识综合起来。

Man’s first sentiment was that of his own existence; his first concern was that of his preservation. The products of the earth provided him with all the help he needed; instinct led him to make use of them. With hunger and other appetites making him experience by turns various ways of existing, there was one appetite that invited him to perpetuate his species; and this blind inclination, devoid of any sentiment of the heart, produced a purely animal act. Once this need had been satisfied, the two sexes would not recognize each other if they met again, and even the child no longer meant anything to the mother once it could do without her. Such was the condition of man in his nascent stage; 
>人的最原始的感情就是对自己生存的感情；最原始的关怀就是对自我保存的关怀。土地的产品，供给他一切必要的东西；本能促使他去利用这些东西。饥饿以及种种欲望，使他反复地经历了各种不同的生存方式，其中之一促使他绵延他的种类；而这种绵延种类的盲目倾向，由于缺乏任何内心情感，因而只能产生一种纯动物性的行为。需要一经满足，两性便互不相识，而孩子本身，一旦能够离开母亲独立生存，也就与她毫无关系了。

such was the life of an animal limited at first to pure sensations, and scarcely profiting from the gifts nature offered him, let alone dreaming of forcing her to hand over

### 70
anything against her will. But difficulties soon presented themselves to him; it was necessary to learn to overcome them. The height of trees, which kept him from reaching their fruits, the competition of animals that sought to feed themselves on these same fruits, the ferocity of those animals that wanted to take his own life: everything obliged him to apply himself to bodily exercises. It was necessary to become agile, fleet-footed, and vigorous in combat. Natural weapons, which are tree branches and stones, were soon found ready at hand. He learned to surmount nature’s obstacles, combat other animals when necessary, fight for his subsistence even with men, or compensate himself for what he had to yield to those stronger than him. 
原始人的情况就是这样；最初仅局限于纯粹感觉、几乎不能利用自然的禀赋、也决想不到向自然有所索取的那种动物的生活就是这样。但是不久困难出现了；因而必须学会如何克服这些困难。树木的高大阻碍他采摘树上的果实；寻找食物的野兽和他争夺食物；还有一些凶猛的野兽甚至要伤害他的生命。这一切都使他不得不致力于身体的锻炼。他必须使自己变成一个灵巧的、奔跑迅速的和勇于战斗的人。树枝、石头等自然武器，不久就到了他的手里。他学会了克服自然的障碍，学会了于必要时战胜别的动物，学会了同其他的人争夺食物，或者也学会了补偿他前此不得不让给更强者的那些东西。

In proportion as the human race spread, difficulties multiplied with the men. Differences in soils, climates, and seasons could force them to introduce corresponding differences in their lifestyles. Barren years, long and hard winters, hot summers that consume everything required new resourcefulness from them. Along the seashore and the riverbanks they invented the fishing line and hook, and became fishermen and fish eaters. In the forests they made bows and arrows and became hunters and warriors. In cold countries they covered themselves with the skins of animals they had killed. Lightning, a volcano, or some lucky accident acquainted them with fire: a new resource against the rigors of winter. They learned to preserve this element, then to reproduce it, and finally to use it to prepare meats that previously they had devoured raw. 
随着人类的繁衍，人们的痛苦也就随人数的增加而增加。土壤、气候和季节的差异，必然会使人们不得不把这种差异带到他们的生活方式中去。荒年、漫长而严寒的冬季、炎热的夏季都能够毁灭一切，因而要求他们具有一种新的技巧。在沿海和沿河的地方，人们发明了钓线和钓钩而变成渔民和以鱼为食的人。在森林地带，人们创造了弓箭而变成猎者和善战的人。在寒带地方，人们就穿起被他们打死的野兽的皮。雷电的闪烁、火山的爆发或者某种侥幸的机会使他们认识了火。这是防御冬季严寒的一种新方法。他们学会了保持火的不灭，然后又学会了生火，最后并学会了用火来炮炙他们以前生吞的肉食。

This repeated counterposition of the various creatures to himself, and of each species to the others, must naturally have engendered in man’s mind a perception of certain relations. These relationships, which we express by the words large, small, strong, weak, fast, slow, timorous, bold, and other similar ideas, comparisons carried out when needed and almost without thinking about it, finally produced in him a kind of reflection, or rather a mechanical prudence that pointed out to him the precautions that were most necessary for his safety. 
>由于人和其他动物以及人与人之间一再接触的结果，在人的心灵中自然会产生对于某些关系的知觉。这些关系，我们用大、小、强、弱、快、慢、勇敢、怯懦等字以及其他于必要时通过几乎无意识的对比而产生的类似观念来表示。这些关系，终于会使人产生了某种思考，或者可以说某种机械的谨慎，这种谨慎会指示他为保障自身的安全而采取最必要的手段。

The new enlightenment that resulted from this development increased his superiority over the other animals by making him aware of it. He trained himself to set traps for them; he tricked them in a thousand different ways. And although several surpassed him in fighting strength or in swiftness in running, of those that could serve him or hurt him, he became in time the master of the former and the scourge of the latter. Thus the first glance he directed upon himself produced within him the first stirrings of pride; thus, as yet hardly knowing how to distinguish the ranks, and contemplating himself in the first rank by virtue of his species, he prepared himself from afar to lay claim to it in virtue of his individuality. 
>从这种发展中所产生的新的知识，使人增加了他比别种动物的优越性，而且也使人认识了这种优越性。人试行对野兽设置陷阱，用千百种方法去诱骗它们。虽然有许多动物在战斗中力量比人大，奔跑得比人快，可是慢慢地，对那些能供人使用的动物，人变成了它们的主人；对那些对人有害的动物，人变成了它们的降灾者。这样，人第一次对自己作了一番观察以后，便产生了最初的自尊的感觉。这样，在他还不大会分别等级的时候，在他想把自己那一类看作第一等的时候，他老早就准备把他个人列为同类中的第一等了。

Although his fellowmen were not for him what they are for us, and although he had hardly anything more to do with them than with other animals, they were not forgotten in his observations. The conformities that over time he could perceive between them, his female, and himself, made him judge those

### 71
he did not perceive. And seeing that they all acted as he would have done under similar circumstances, he concluded that their way of thinking and feeling was in complete conformity with his own. And this important truth, well established in his mind, made him follow, by a presentiment as sure as dialectic and more prompt, the best rules of conduct that it was appropriate to observe toward them for his advantage and safety. 
>虽然他的同类对他的关系不象现今我们的同类对我们的关系一样，虽然他和他的同类并不比和其他禽兽有更多的来往，可是他也不会完全忽略对他的同类加以观察。时间一久，他就会看出在他的同类之间、在他的雌性和他自己之间有许多相同之点，他并能据此推断出另一些尚未被他发现的相同之点。当他发现在同样情形下，大家的行动和他自己的行动都一样的时候，他便可以推知大家的思想方法和对事物的感觉与他自己的想法和感觉也是完全相同的。这个重要的真理，一旦在他的心灵中得到证实，通过一种与推理方法同样确切而比推理方法更为直接的预感，便可以促使他在与他人交往时，遵循着为了自己的利益和安全所应遵守的最好的行为规则。

Taught by experience that love of well-being is the sole motive of human actions, he found himself in a position to distinguish the rare occasions when common interest should make him count on the assistance of his fellowmen, and those even rarer occasions when competition ought to make him distrust them. In the first case, he united with them in a herd, or at most in some sort of free association, that obligated no one and that lasted only as long as the passing need that had formed it. In the second case, everyone sought to obtain his own advantage, either by overt force, if he believed he could, or by cleverness and cunning, if he felt himself to be the weaker.
>经验告诉他，追求幸福乃是人类活动的唯一动力，因而他能够区分两种情况：一、由于共同利益，他可以指望同类的帮助，这是一种稀有的情况；二、由于彼此间的竞争，他不能信任他的同类，这是更稀有的情况。在第一种情况下，他和他的同类结合成群，或者至多也不过结合成某种自由的团体，这种团体并不拘束任何人，它的存续期间也不会超过促使该团体形成的那种临时需要的存在期间。在第二种情况下，每个人为了力求获取自己的利益，如果相信自己有足够的力量，便公开使用强力，如果觉得自己比较弱，便使用智巧。

This is how men could imperceptibly acquire some crude idea of mutual commitments and of the advantages to be had in fulfilling them, but only insofar as present and perceptible interests could require it, since foresight meant nothing to them, and far from concerning themselves about a distant future, they did not even give a thought to the next day. Were it a matter of catching a deer, everyone was quite aware that he must faithfully keep to his post in order to achieve this purpose; but if a hare happened to pass within reach of one of them, no doubt he would have pursued it without giving it a second thought, and that, having obtained his prey, he cared very little about causing his companions to miss theirs. 
人类就是这样于不知不觉中获得了对相互间的义务以及履行这些义务的好处的粗浅观念。但是，只有在目前的和显而易见的利害对他们有这样要求的时候，才会产生这种观念，因为他们毫无预见，不用说遥远的将来，甚至连第二天的事情都不会想到。如果大家在捕一只鹿，每人都很知道应该忠实地守着自己的岗位。但是如果有一只兔从其中一人的眼前跑过，这个人一定会毫不迟疑地去追捕这只免；当他捕到了兔以后，他的同伴们因此而没有捕到他们的猎获物这件事，他会不大在意，这是无须怀疑的。

It is easy to understand that such intercourse did not require a language much more refined than that of crows or monkeys, which flock together in practically the same way. Inarticulate cries, many gestures, and some imitative noises must for a long time have made up the universal language. By joining to this in each country a few articulate and conventional sounds, whose institution, as I have already said, is not too easy to explain, there arose individual languages, but crude and imperfect ones, quite similar to those still spoken by various savage nations today. Constrained by the passing of time, the abundance of things I have to say, and the practically imperceptible progress of the beginnings, I am flying like an arrow over the multitudes of centuries. For the slower events were in succeeding one another, the quicker they can be described. These first advances enabled man to make more rapid ones. The more the mind was enlightened, the more skills were perfected. Soon they ceased to fall asleep under the first tree or to retreat into caves, and found various types of hatchets made of hard, sharp stones, which served to cut wood, dig up the soil, and make huts from branches they later found it useful to cover with clay and mud. This was the period of a first revolution, which formed the establishment of the distinction among families and which introduced a kind of property, whence perhaps there already arose many

### 72
quarrels and fights. However, since the strongest were probably the first to make themselves lodgings they felt capable of defending, presumably the weak found it quicker and safer to imitate them than to try to dislodge them; and as for those who already had huts, each of them must have rarely sought to appropriate that of his neighbor, less because it did not belong to him than because it was of no use to him, and because he could not seize it without exposing himself to a fierce battle with the family that occupied it. 
我们不难理解，人们相互间的这种关系，并不需要比差不多同样结合成群的乌鸦或猴子的语言更为细致的语言。在很长时期内，人们普通的语言必定是由无音节的叫声、很多的手势和一些模拟的声音组成的。在各个地区对这种语言再加上一些有音节的和约定的声音（关于最初语言的制定，我前面曾经说过是不大容易解释的），于是人们便有了许多个别的语言，不过这种语言都是粗糙和不完备的，很象今天许多野蛮民族仍在使用着的语言一样。由于时间的悠久，而我要说明的事物又过于繁复，同时，人类初期的进步几乎使人不易觉察，所以我不得不在转瞬之间跨过无数世纪。因为，事物的演变过程越缓慢，便越应当以简练的笔法来描写。这些初期的进步，终于使人能够取得更快的进步。智慧越发达，技巧便越趋于完善。不久，人们就不再睡在随便哪一棵树下，或躲在洞穴里了。他们发明了几种坚硬而锋利的石斧，用来截断树木，挖掘土地，用树枝架成小棚；随后又想到把这小棚敷上一层泥土。这就是第一次变革的时代，这一变革促进了家庭的形成和家庭的区分，从此便出现了某种形式的私有制，许多的争执和战斗也就从而产生了。可是，首先建造住所的，似乎都是一些最强悍的人，因为只有他们才觉得自己有力量保护它。我们可以断定，弱者必然会感到与其企图把强者从那些小屋里赶走，不如模仿他们来建造住所更为省事和可靠。至于已经有了小屋的人，谁也不会去占据邻人的小屋，这倒不是因为邻人的屋子不属于他所有，而是因为那小屋对他没什么用处，并且如果要占据它，难免要和居住那小屋的家庭作一场激烈的战斗。

The first developments of the heart were the effect of a new situation that united the husbands and wives, fathers and children in one common habitation. The habit of living together gave rise to the sweetest sentiments known to men: conjugal love and parental love. Each family became a little society all the better united because mutual attachment and liberty were its only bonds; and it was then that the first difference was established in the lifestyle of the two sexes, which until then had had only one. Women became more sedentary and grew accustomed to watch over the hut and the children, while the man went to seek their common subsistence. With their slightly softer life, the two sexes also began to lose something of their ferocity and vigor. But while each one separately became less suited to combat savage beasts, on the other hand it was easier to assemble in order to jointly resist them. 
>人类情感最初的发展，乃是一种新的情况的结果，这种新的情况把丈夫、妻子、父母、子女结合在一个共同住所里。共同生活的习惯，使人产生了人类所有情感中最温柔的情感：夫妇的爱和父母的爱，每个家庭变成一个结合得更好的小社会，因为相互依恋和自由是联系这一小社会的唯一的纽带。于是，在男女两性的生活方式之间产生了最初的差别，在此以前，男女两性本来是只有一种生活方式的。从此，妇女便经常家居，并习惯于看守小屋和孩子；男人则出去寻找共同的生活资料。由于得到了一种比较舒适的生活，两性都开始失去一部分强悍性和气力。虽然；每个人单独战胜野兽的力量不如以前，但在另一方面，他们却比以前更便于集合起来共同抵御野兽了。

In this new state, with a simple and solitary life, very limited needs, and the tools they had invented to provide for them, since men enjoyed a great deal of leisure time, they used it to procure for themselves many types of conveniences unknown to their fathers; and that was the first yoke they imposed on themselves without realizing it, and the first source of evils they prepared for their descendants. For in addition to their continuing thus to soften body and mind (those conveniences having through habit lost almost all their pleasure, and being at the same time degenerated into true needs), being deprived of them became much more cruel than possessing them was sweet; and they were unhappy about losing them without being happy about possessing them. 
>在这种新的状态中，人们过着简单的、很少来往的生活，他们的需要很有限，并且使用着为满足这些需要而发明的一些工具，因此他们能够享有较多的闲暇，用来为自己安排他们的祖先所不知的各式各样的舒适的享受。这是人们于无意中给自己带上的第一个枷锁，同时这也就是给他们后代准备下的最初的痛苦的根源。因为，除了他们这样使身体和精神继续衰弱下去以外，这些舒适的享受一旦成为习惯，便使人几乎完全感觉不到乐趣，而变成了人的真正的需要。于是，得不到这些享受时的痛苦比得到这些享受时的快乐要大得多，而且有了这些享受不见得幸福，失掉了这些享受却真感到苦恼了。

At this point we can see a little better how the use of speech was established or imperceptibly perfected itself in the bosom of each family; and one can further conjecture how various particular causes could have extended the language and accelerated its progress by making it more necessary. Great floods or earthquakes surrounded the inhabited areas with water or precipices. Upheavals of the globe detached parts of the mainland and broke them up into islands. Clearly among men thus brought together and forced to live together, a common idiom must have been formed sooner than among those who wandered freely about the forests of the mainland. Thus it is quite possible that after their first attempts at navigation, the islanders brought the use of speech to us; and it is at least quite probable that society and languages came into being on islands and were perfected there before they were known on the mainland.
>在这里我们可以比较清楚地看出，语言的使用是怎样建立起来的，或者它在各个家庭中是怎样不知不觉地趋于完善的。而且还可以揣测各种特殊的原因怎样使语言变得更为必要，从而扩大了它的使用并加速了它的发展。洪水泛滥或者地震使一些有人居住的地方被水或悬崖峭壁所包围；地球的变迁使大陆的某些部分割裂为岛屿。我们不难想象，这样接近起来而不得不营共同生活的人们之间，比起在大陆森林中飘泊流浪着的人们之间，应当更容易形成一种共同的方言。因此，很可能是这样：岛上的居民经过最初的试航以后，便给我们大陆带来了使用语言的习惯；或者，至少也可能是这样：在大陆上还不知道什么叫做社会和语言之前，岛上已经建立了社会，产生了语言，而且这两者已经达到了相当完善的程度。

### 73
Everything begins to take on a new appearance. Having previously wandered about the forests and having assumed a more fixed situation, men slowly came together and united into different bands, eventually forming in each country a particular nation, united by mores and characteristic features, not by regulations and laws, but by the same kind of life and foods and by the common influence of the climate. Eventually a permanent proximity cannot fail to engender some intercourse among different families. Young people of different sexes live in neighboring huts; the passing intercourse demanded by nature soon leads to another, through frequent contact with one another, no less sweet and more permanent. People become accustomed to consider different objects and to make comparisons. Imperceptibly they acquire the ideas of merit and beauty that produce feelings of preference. By dint of seeing one another, they can no longer get along without seeing one another again. A sweet and tender feeling insinuates itself into the soul and at the least opposition becomes an impetuous fury. Jealousy awakens with love; discord triumphs, and the sweetest passion receives sacrifices of human blood. 
>于是一切都开始改变了面貌。那些一向在森林中飘泊的人们，由于有了一个比较固定的地区，渐渐地互相接近起来，结合成各种集团，并终于在各个地方形成了有共同风俗和性格的个别民族。这些人所以形成个别民族并不是由于规章和法律，而是由于过着同一方式的生活，以同样食物为生，并受着相同气候的影响。长期的毗邻难免不使各家庭之间发生某些联系。青年男女居住在毗邻的小屋里，基于自然的要求而发生的临时关系，继之以日益频繁的来往，不久就变成另一种同样亲密而更为持久的关系。人们逐渐习惯于考虑不同的对象并加以比较，于是在不知不觉中获得了才能和美丽的观念，由此便产生出偏爱的感情。由于不断相见的结果，一不相见便怅然若有所失。一种温柔甜密的感情渗入心灵之中，这种感情因很小的冲突就会变成激烈的愤怒。嫉妒随着爱情而出现，一旦反目，最温柔的感情就会酿成人血的牺牲。

In proportion as ideas and sentiments succeed one another and as the mind and heart are trained, the human race continues to be tamed, relationships spread, and bonds are tightened. People grew accustomed to gather in front of their huts or around a large tree; song and dance, true children of love and leisure, became the amusement or rather the occupation of idle men and women who had flocked together. Each one began to look at the others and to want to be looked at himself, and public esteem had a value. The one who sang or danced the best, the handsomest, the strongest, the most adroit, or the most eloquent became the most highly regarded. And this was the first step toward inequality and, at the same time, toward vice. From these first preferences were born vanity and contempt on the one hand, and shame and envy on the other. And the fermentation caused by these new leavens eventually produced compounds fatal to happiness and innocence. 
>随着观念和感情的互相推动，精神和心灵的相互为用，人类便日益文明化。联系日多，关系也就日益紧密。人们习惯于聚集在小屋前面或大树周围，歌唱与舞蹈——爱情和闲暇的真实产物——变成了悠闲的、成群的男女们的娱乐，甚至成为他们的日常生活事项。每个人都开始注意别人，也愿意别人注意自己。于是公众的重视具有了一种价值。最善于歌舞的人、最美的人、最有力的人、最灵巧的人或最有口才的人，变成了最受尊重的人。这就是走向不平等的第一步；同时也是走向邪恶的第一步。从这些最初的爱好中，一方面产生了虚荣和轻蔑，另一方面也产生了羞惭和羡慕。这些新因素所引起的紊乱，终于产生了对幸福和天真生活的不幸的后果。

As soon as men had begun mutually to value one another, and the idea of esteem was formed in their minds, each one claimed to have a right to it, and it was no longer possible for anyone to be lacking it with impunity. From this came the first duties of civility, even among savages; and from this every voluntary wrong became an outrage, because along with the harm that resulted from the injury, the offended party saw in it contempt for his person, which often was more insufferable than the harm itself. Hence each man punished the contempt shown him in a manner proportionate to the esteem in which he held himself; acts of revenge became terrible, and men became bloodthirsty and cruel. This is precisely the stage reached by most of the savage people known to us; and it is for want of having made adequate distinctions among their ideas or of having noticed how far these peoples already were from the original state of nature that many have hastened to conclude that man is naturally cruel, and that he needs civilization in order to soften him. On the contrary, nothing is so gentle as man in his primitive

### 74
state, when, placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal enlightenment of civil man, and limited equally by instinct and reason to protecting himself from the harm that threatens him, he is restrained by natural pity from needlessly harming anyone himself, even if he has been harmed. For according to the axiom of the wise Locke, “where there is no property, there is no injury.”[48]
>人们一开始相互品评，尊重的观念一在他们心灵中形成，每个人都认为自己有被尊重的权利，而且一个人不为人尊重而不感到任何不便，已成为不可能的了。由此便产生了最初的礼让的义务，甚至在野蛮人之间也是如此。从此，一切有意的侵害都变成了凌辱，因为，除了由于损害所产生的损失之外，受害者还认为那是对他的人格的轻视，而这种轻视往往比损失本身还更难忍受。这样，由于每一个人对他所受到的轻视怎样予以惩罚，是按照他对自己的尊重程度来决定的，所以，报复就变成了可怕的事情，人也就变成了好杀而残忍的动物。我们所知道的大多数野蛮民族曾经进化到的程度正是这样。许多人没有把这些观念辨别清楚，没有注意到这些民族已经离开了最初的自然状态有多么远，竟草率地作出结论说，人天生是残忍的，需要文明制度来使他们变为温和。实际上，再没有比原始状态中的人那么温和的了，在那个时候，人被自然安排得距离野兽的愚钝和文明人的不幸的智慧都一样远，他为本能也同样为理性所限，只知道防备所面临的祸害的威胁，他为自然的怜悯心所制约，不会主动地加害于人，即使受到别人的侵害也不会那样去做。因为按照贤明的洛克的格言：在没有私有制的地方是不会有不公正的。 

But it must be noted that society in its beginning stages and the relations already established among men required in them qualities different from those they derived from their primitive constitution; that, with morality beginning to be introduced into human actions, and everyone, prior to the existence of laws, being sole judge and avenger of the offenses he had received, the goodness appropriate to the pure state of nature was no longer what was appropriate to an emerging society; that it was necessary for punishments to become more severe in proportion as the occasions for giving offense became more frequent; and that it was for the fear of vengeance to take the place of the deterrent character of laws. Hence although men had become less forbearing, and although natural pity had already undergone some alteration, this period of the development of human faculties, maintaining a middle position between the indolence of our primitive state and the petulant activity of our egocentrism [ amour propre ], must have been the happiest and most durable epoch. The more one reflects on it, the more one finds that this state was the least subject to upheavals and the best for man, xvi and that he must have left it only by virtue of some fatal chance happening that, for the common good, ought never have happened. The example of savages, almost all of whom have been found in this state, seems to confirm that the human race had been made to remain in it always; that this state is the veritable youth of the world; and that all the subsequent progress has been in appearance so many steps toward the perfection of the individual, and in fact toward the decay of the species. 
>但是，我们也应当注意：已经开始建立的社会和在人们之间已经建立起来的种种关系，要求人们所具有的性质，已不同于他们的原始体质中所禀赋的性质。由于道德观念已开始渗入人类行为之中，由于在没有法律以前，每一个人都是自己所受侵害的唯一裁判者和报复者，因此适合于纯粹自然状态的善良已不适合于新产生的社会。随着互相侵害的机会日益增多，对侵害所施行的报复也就日益严酷。在那个时候，正是报复的恐怖代替了法律的制裁。这样，尽管人们已变得忍耐性不那么强了，尽管自然的怜悯心已有了某种程度的变性，但是人类能力的这一发展阶段是恰恰处于介乎原始状态中的悠闲自在和我们今天自尊心的急剧活动之间的一个时期，这应该是最幸福而最持久的一个时期。对于这一点我们越加深思，便越觉得这种状态极不易发生变革，而且也是最适合于人类的一种状态〔十六〕；除非由于某种不幸的偶然事件，人类是不会脱离这种状态的。为了人类的共同利益，这种偶然事件最好是永不发生。我们所发现的野蛮人，几乎都是处在这种状态。从他们的事例中，似乎可以证实：人类生来就是为了永远停留在这样的状态。这种状态是人世的真正青春，后来的一切进步只是个人完美化方向上的表面的进步，而实际上它们引向人类的没落。

As long as men were content with the rustic huts, as long as they were limited to making their clothing out of skins sewn together with thorns or fish bones, adorning themselves with feathers and shells, painting their bodies with various colors, perfecting or embellishing their bows and arrows, using sharp-edged stones to make some fishing canoes or some crude musical instruments; in a word, as long as they applied themselves exclusively to tasks that a single individual could do and to the arts that did not require the cooperation of several hands, they lived as free, healthy, good, and happy as they could in accordance with their nature; and they continued to enjoy among themselves the sweet rewards of independent intercourse. But as soon as one man needed the help of another, as soon as one man realized that it was useful for a single individual to have provisions for two, equality disappeared, property came into existence, labor became necessary. Vast forests

>48 [ Essay Concerning Human Understanding, bk. 4, ch. 3, §18.]


### 75
were transformed into smiling fields that had to be watered with men’s sweat, and in which slavery and misery were soon seen to germinate and grow with the crops.
>当人们满足于自己的粗陋的小屋的时候；当人们还局限于用荆刺和鱼骨缝制兽皮衣服、用羽毛和贝壳来装饰自己、把身体涂上各种颜色、把弓箭制造得更为精良和美观、用石斧作渔船或某些粗糙的乐器的时候；总之，当他们仅从事于一个人能单独操作的工作和不需要许多人协助的手艺的时候，他们都还过着本性所许可的自由、健康、善良而幸福的生活，并且在他们之间继续享受着无拘无束自由交往的快乐。但是，自从一个人需要另一个人的帮助的时候起；自从人们觉察到个人据有两个人食粮的好处的时候起；平等就消失了、私有制就出现了、劳动就成为必要的了、广大的森林就变成了须用人的血汗来灌溉的欣欣向荣的田野；不久便看到奴役和贫困伴随着农作物在田野中萌芽和滋长。 

Metallurgy and agriculture were the two arts whose invention produced this great revolution. For the poet, it is gold and silver; but for the philosopher, it is iron and wheat that have civilized men and sealed the fate of the human race. Thus they were both unknown to the savages of America, who for that reason have always remained savages. Other peoples even appear to have remained barbarous, as long as they practiced one of those arts without the other. And perhaps one of the best reasons why Europe has been, if not sooner, at least more constantly and better governed than the other parts of the world, is that it is at the same time the most abundant in iron and the most fertile in wheat. 
>冶金术和农业这两种技术的发明，引起了这一巨大的变革。使人文明起来，而使人类没落下去的东西，在诗人看来是金和银，而在哲学家看来是铁和谷物。冶金术和农业这两种技术，都是美洲野蛮人所不知道的，因此他们一直停留在未开化状态；其他民族，在还不能同时运用这两种技术的时候，好象也仍然停留在野蛮状态。欧洲的开化，与其他各洲相比，虽不算早，但我们至少可以说它的文明在发展的过程中较少间断，因此，文明化的程度也较高；其所以如此，最主要原因之一，或许是因为欧洲不仅是产铁最多，同时也是产麦子最为丰富的地方。

It is very difficult to guess how men came to know and use iron, for one cannot believe that by themselves they thought of drawing the ore from the mine and performing the necessary preparations on it for smelting it before they knew what would result. From another point of view, it is even less plausible to attribute this discovery to some accidental fire, because mines are set up exclusively in arid places devoid of trees and plants, so that one would say that nature had taken precautions to conceal this deadly secret from us. Thus there remains only the extraordinary circumstance of some volcano that, in casting forth molten metal, would have given observers the idea of imitating this operation of nature. Even then we must suppose them to have had a great deal of courage and foresight to undertake such a difficult task and to have envisaged so far in advance the advantages they could derive from it. This is hardly suitable except for minds already better trained than theirs ought to have been.
>很难猜测人类对铁的认识和使用是怎样开始的，在不能预知其结果以前，他们自己就能想出从矿藏中提炼某种物质以及为了熔炼这种物质所应做的各种准备，那是难以设想的。另一方面，我们也不能把这个发明归因于某些偶然火灾，因为矿藏只是在没有树木和其它植物的不毛之地逐渐形成的。因此我们可以说自然已经加了小心，不让我们发现这个不幸的秘密。只有在极不常见的情况下，某一火山突然爆发，喷出正在熔化中的金属物质，才会使看见的人想到模仿自然，从事冶炼金属。即使如此，我们还须假定他们有足够的勇气和预见，来进行那么艰难的工作，并且那么早就能推想到可以从中获取利益。这类事情只有智慧比较发达的人才能想到，而那时的人是不会有这种智慧的。 

As for agriculture, its principle was known long before its practice was established, and it is hardly possible that men, constantly preoccupied with deriving their subsistence from trees and plants, did not rather quickly get the idea of the methods used by nature to grow plant life. But their skills probably did not turn in that direction until very late either because trees, which, along with hunting and fishing, provided their nourishment, had no need of their care; or for want of knowing how to use wheat; or for want of tools with which to cultivate it; or for want of foresight regarding future needs; or, finally, for want of the means of preventing others from appropriating the fruits of their labors. Having become more skillful, it is credible that, with sharp stones and pointed sticks, they began by cultivating some vegetables or roots around their huts long before they knew how to prepare wheat and had the tools necessary for large-scale cultivation. Moreover, to devote oneself to that occupation and to sow the lands, one must be resolved to lose something at first in order to gain a great deal later: a precaution quite far removed from the mind of savage man, who, as I have said, finds it quite difficult to give thought in the morning to what he will need at night.
>至于农业，远在实践开始以前，它的原理就被人认识了。人们既然不断从事由树木和其他植物上采取食物，对于自然为繁殖植物所用的方法，几乎不可能不很快地获得一种观念。但是他们也许很晚才把智巧使用到这方面来；其所以如此，或者是因为树木和渔猎一样，可以供给他们食物，并用不着他们去照管，或者是因为他们还不知道谷物的用处，或者是因为没有种植谷物的工具，或者是因为不能预见到未来的需要，最后，或者是因为没有方法防止他人侵占他们的劳动成果。当他们变得更为智巧一些的时候，我们可以相信，他们就开始用锐利的石头和带尖的木棒，在他们的小屋周围种植一些蔬菜或根菜作物。这样，经过很长时期以后，他们才知道种植谷物，才能够获得从事大规模耕种所必要的工具。当然，还不必说，要从事农业这种技术，必须先肯于牺牲一些东西，然后才能收获更多的东西，野蛮人的脑筋是不会有这种远见的。因为他们正如我前面说过的一样，连在早晨想到晚上的需要都很不容易。

The invention of the other arts was therefore necessary to force the human race to apply itself to that of agriculture. Once men were needed in order to smelt and forge iron, other men were needed in order to feed them. The more the number of workers increased, the fewer hands there were to obtain food for the common subsistence, without there being fewer mouths to consume it; and since some needed foodstuffs in exchange for their iron, the others finally found the secret of using iron to multiply foodstuffs. From this there arose farming and agriculture, on the one hand, and the art of working metals and multiplying their uses, on the other.
>因此，为使人类致力于农业，其他各种技术的发明就是必要的了。自从必须有一些人从事熔铁和打铁工作的时候起，就需要另外一些人来养活他们。工人的数目越增多，从事供给公共生活资料的人数就越减少，但是消费生活资料的人口并没有减少。而且，因为必须给某一些人若干生产品来换取他们的铁，另外一些人终于发明了利用铁来增多生产品的秘诀。因此，一方面出现了耕耘法和农业；另方面出现了金属加工和推广金属用途的技术。

From the cultivation of land, there necessarily followed the division of land; and from property once recognized, the first rules of justice. For in order to render everyone what is his, it is necessary that everyone can have something. Moreover, as men began to look toward the future and as they saw that they all had goods to lose, there was not one of them who did not have to fear reprisals against himself for wrongs he might do to another. This origin is all the more natural as it is impossible to conceive of the idea of property arising from anything but manual labor, for it is not clear what man can add, beyond his own labor, in order to appropriate things he has not made. It is labor alone that, in giving the cultivator a right to the product of the soil he has tilled, consequently gives him a right, at least until the harvest, and thus from year to year. With this possession continuing uninterrupted, it is easily transformed into property. When the ancients, says Grotius, gave Ceres the epithet of legislatrix, gave the name Thesmophoria to a festival celebrated in her honor, they thereby made it apparent that the division of lands has produced a new kind of right: namely, the right of property, different from that which results from the natural law.[49]
> 土地的耕种必然会导致土地的分配，而私有一旦被承认，也必然会产生最初的公正规则。因为，要把各个人的东西返还给各个人，是以每个人能有一些东西为前提的；由于人们已经开始注意到未来，同时每个人都感觉到自己有些可以失掉的东西，因此每个人都怕由于损害他人而使自己遭到报复。这种起源之所以是很合乎自然的，特别是因为我们不可能撇开劳动去设想新生的私有观念。我们不能理解一个人要把并非自己创造的东西据为己有，除了因为添加了自己的劳动以外，还能因为添加了什么别的东西？只有劳动才能给予耕种者对于他所耕种的土地的出产物的权利，因而也给予他对于土地本身的权利，至少是到收获时为止。这样年复一年地下去，连续占有就很容易转化为私有。格老秀斯说过，古代人曾给赛来斯女神以立法者的称号并把纪念她的节日命名为“黛丝摩福里”，他们的意思是：由于土地的分配而产生了一种新的权利，即所有权，这种权利和从自然法中所产生的权利是不相同的。

Things in this state could have remained equal, if talents had been equal, and if the use of iron and the consumption of foodstuffs had always been in precise balance. But this proportion was not maintained by anything, and was soon broken. The strongest did the most work; the most adroit turned theirs to better advantage; the most ingenious found ways to shorten their labor. The farmer had a greater need for iron, or the blacksmith had a greater need for wheat; and in laboring equally, the one earned a great deal while the other barely had enough to live. Thus it is that natural inequality imperceptibly manifests itself together with inequality occasioned by the socialization process. Thus it is that the differences among men, developed by those of circumstances, make themselves more noticeable, more permanent in their effects, and begin to influence the fate of private individuals in the same proportion. 
>在这种状态中，一切事物可能始终是平等的，如果人们的才能是相等的话，例如，铁的使用与生产品的消费总能经常保持准确的平衡。但是，这种均衡，什么也维持不住，不久，就被打破了。强壮的人作的工作较多；灵巧的人可以从自己的劳作中获得较多的利益；聪明的人找到了一些缩短劳动的方法；或者农民需要更多的铁，或者铁匠需要更多的麦子。虽然彼此都同样地劳动，但有的人获得很多的报酬；有的人维持生活都有困难。这样，自然的不平等，不知不觉地随着“关系”的不平等而展开了。因此，由于情况不同而发展起来的人与人之间的差异，在效果上就更加显著，也更为持久，并且在同样的比例上开始影响着人们的命运。

With things having reached this point, it is easy to imagine the rest. I will not stop to describe the successive invention of the arts, the progress of languages, the testing and use of talents, the inequality of fortunes, the use

or abuse of wealth, nor all the details that follow these and that everyone can easily supply. I will limit myself exclusively to taking a look at the human race placed in this new order of things. 
>事物发展到这种程度，其余的便不难想象了。我不必再费时间，来描写其他各种技术的相继发明、语言的发展、才能的试验和使用、财产的不平等、财富的利用或滥用；我也不必描写伴随着这些事物而来的一切详细情节，因为那是每个读者都不难自己加以补充的。我不过将要概括地观察一下处在这种新的事物顺序中的人类而已。

Thus we find here all our faculties developed, memory and imagination in play, egocentrism [ amour propre ] looking out for its interests, reason rendered active, and the mind having nearly reached the limit of the perfection of which it is capable. We find here all the natural qualities put into action, the rank and fate of each man established not only on the basis of the quantity of goods and the power to serve or harm, but also on the basis of intelligence, beauty, strength, or skill, on the basis of merit or talents. And since these qualities were the only ones that could attract consideration, he was soon forced to have them or affect them. It was necessary, for his advantage, to show himself to be something other than what he in fact was. Being something and appearing to be something became two completely different things; and from this distinction there arose grandiose ostentation, deceptive cunning, and all the vices that follow in their wake. On the other hand, although man had previously been free and independent, we find him, so to speak, subject, by virtue of a multitude of fresh needs, to all of nature and particularly to his fellowmen, whose slave in a sense he becomes even in becoming their master: rich, he needs their services; poor, he needs their help; and being midway between wealth and poverty does not put him in a position to get along without them. It is therefore necessary for him to seek incessantly to interest them in his fate and to make them find their own profit, in fact or in appearance, in working for his. This makes him two-faced and crooked with some, imperious and harsh with others, and puts him in the position of having to abuse everyone he needs when he cannot make them fear him and does not find it in his interests to be of useful service to them. Finally, consuming ambition, the zeal for raising the relative level of his fortune, less out of real need than in order to put himself above others, inspires in all men a wicked tendency to harm one another, a secret jealousy all the more dangerous because, in order to strike its blow in greater safety, it often wears the mask of benevolence; in short, competition and rivalry on the one hand, opposition of interest on the other, and always the hidden desire to profit at the expense of someone else. All these ills are the first effect of property and the inseparable offshoot of incipient inequality. 
>这时，人类的一切能力都发展了，记忆力和想象力展开了活动；自尊心加强了；理性活跃起来了；智慧已几乎达到了它可能达到的最完善的程度。这时，一切天赋的性质都发挥了作用，每个人的等级和命运不仅是建立在财产的多寡以及每个人有利于人或有害于人的能力上，而且还建立在聪明、美丽、体力、技巧、功绩或才能等种种性质上。只有这些性质才能引起人的重视，所以，每个人都必须很快地具有这些性质或常常利用这些性质。自己实际上是一种样子，但为了本身的利益，不得不显出另一种样子。于是，“实际是”和“看来是”变成迥然不同的两回事。由于有了这种区别便产生了浮夸的排场；欺人的诡计以及随之而来的一切邪恶。另一方面，从前本是自由、自主的人，如今由于无数新的需要，可以说已不得不受整个自然界的支配，特别是不得不受他的同类的支配。纵使他变成了他的同类的主人，在某种意义上说，却同时也变成了他的同类的奴隶：富有，他就需要他们的服侍；贫穷，他就需要他们的援助；不穷不富也决不能不需要他们。于是他必须不断地设法使他们关心他的命运，并使他们在实际上或在表面上感到为他的利益服务，便可以获得他们自己的利益。这样，就使得他对一部分人变得奸诈和虚伪；对另一部分人变得专横和冷酷，并且，当他不能使一些人畏惧自己，或者当他认为服侍另一些人对他没有什么好处的时候，他便不得不欺骗他所需要的一切人。最后，永无止境的野心，与其说是出于真正需要，勿宁说是为了使自己高人一等的聚积财富的热狂，使所有的人都产生一种损害他人的阴险意图和一种隐蔽的嫉妒心。这种嫉妒心是特别阴险的，因为它为了便于达到目的，往往戴着伪善的面具。总而言之，一方面是竞争和倾轧，另一方面是利害冲突，人人都时时隐藏着损人利己之心。这一切灾祸，都是私有财产的第一个后果，同时也是新产生的不平等的必然产物。

Before signs to represent wealth had been invented, it could hardly have consisted of anything but lands and livestock, the only real goods men can possess. Now when inheritances had grown in number and size to the point of covering the entire landscape and of all bordering on one another, some could no longer be enlarged except at the expense of others; and the supernumeraries, whom weakness or indolence had prevented from acquiring an inheritance in their turn, became poor without having lost anything, because while everything changed around them, they alone had not changed at all. Thus they were forced to receive or steal their subsistence from the hands of

### 78
the rich. And from that there began to arise, according to the diverse characters of the rich and the poor, domination and servitude, or violence and thefts. For their part, the wealthy had no sooner known the pleasure of domination, than before long they disdained all others, and using their old slaves to subdue new ones, they thought of nothing but the subjugation and enslavement of their neighbors, like those ravenous wolves that, on having once tasted human flesh, reject all other food and desire to devour only men. 
>在人们还没有发明代表财富的符号以前，财富的内容只包括土地和家畜，只包括人们能够占有的现实财产。而当不动产在数量和面积上增长到布满了整个地面并都互相毗连起来的时候，一个人只有损害他人才能扩大自己的财产。那些或因软弱或因懒惰错过了取得财产机会的人们，虽然没有失掉任何东西，却变成了穷人。因为他们周围的一切都变了，只有他们自己没有变，于是他们不得不从富人手里接受或抢夺生活必需品。从此，由于富人和穷人彼此间各种不同的性格，开始产生了统治和奴役或者暴力和掠夺。在富人方面，他们一认识了统治的快乐，便立即鄙弃一切其他的快乐。并且，因为他们可以利用旧奴隶来制服新奴隶，所以他们只想征服和奴役他们的邻人。他们好象饿狼一样，尝过一次人肉以后，便厌弃一切别的食物，而只想吃人了。

Thus, when both the most powerful or the most miserable made of their strength or their needs a sort of right to another’s goods, equivalent, according to them, to the right of property, the destruction of equality was followed by the most frightful disorder. Thus the usurpations of the rich, the acts of brigandage by the poor, the unbridled passions of all, stifling natural pity and the still weak voice of justice, made men greedy, ambitious, and wicked. There arose between the right of the strongest and the right of the first occupant a perpetual conflict that ended only in fights and murders. xvii Emerging society gave way to the most horrible state of war; since the human race, debased and distressed, was no longer able to retrace its steps or give up the unfortunate acquisitions it had made, and since it labored only toward its shame by abusing the faculties that honor it, it brought itself to the brink of its ruin. “Horrified by the newness of the ill, both the poor man and the rich man hope to flee from wealth, hating what they once had prayed for.”[50]

>这样，因为最强者或最贫者把他们的力量或他们的需要视为一种对他人财产上的权利，而这种权利按照他们的看法就等于所有权，所以平等一被破坏，继之而来的就是最可怕的混乱。这样，因为富人的豪夺、穷人的抢劫以及一切人毫无节制的情欲，扼杀了自然怜悯心和还很微弱的公正的声音①，于是使人变得悭吝、贪婪和邪恶。在最强者的权利和先占者的权利之间发生了无穷尽的冲突，这种冲突只能以战斗和残杀而终结〔十七〕。新产生的社会让位于最可怕的战争状态：堕落而悲惨的人类，再也不能从已踏上的道路折回，再也不能抛弃已经获得的那些不幸的获得物，同时他们努力以赴的只不过是滥用使自己获得荣誉的种种能力，从而为自己招致恶果，并终于使自己走到了毁灭的边缘。"他被新发生的灾祸惊呆了，又有钱又可怜，他只想逃避财富，并憎恶他曾经馨香祝祷的东西了。"

It is not possible that men should not have eventually reflected upon so miserable a situation and upon the calamities that overwhelm them. The rich in particular must have soon felt how disadvantageous to them it was to have a perpetual war in which they alone paid all the costs, and in which the risk of losing one’s life was common to all and the risk of losing one’s goods was personal. Moreover, regardless of the light in which they tried to place their usurpations, they knew full well that they were established on nothing but a precarious and abusive right, and that having been acquired merely by force, force might take them away from them without their having any reason to complain. Even those enriched exclusively by their skills could hardly base their property on better claims. They could very well say: “I am the one who built that wall; I have earned this land with my labor.” In response to them it could be said: “Who gave you the boundary lines? By what right do you lay claim to exact payment at our expense for labor we did not impose upon you? Are you unaware that a multitude of your brothers perish or suffer from need of what you have in excess, and that you needed explicit and unanimous consent from the human race for you to help yourself to anything from the common subsistence that went beyond your own immediate needs?” Bereft of valid reasons to justify himself and sufficient forces to defend himself; easily crushing a private individual, but himself crushed by troops of bandits; alone against all and unable on account of mutual jealousies to unite with his

### 79
equals against enemies united by the common hope of plunder, a rich man, pressed by necessity, finally conceived the most thought-out project that ever entered the human mind. It was to use in his favor the very strength of those who attacked him, to turn his adversaries into his defenders, to instill in them other maxims, and to give them other institutions that were as favorable to him as natural right was unfavorable to him. 
> 人们对于这样悲惨的境遇和压在他们身上的灾难始终不加考虑，毕竟是不可能的。特别是富人很快就会感觉到一切费用都由他们负担的长期战争对自己是多么不利；在战争中，生命上的冒险虽是大家共同的，而财产上的冒险，则只是富人自己的。此外，无论富人怎样掩饰自己巧取豪夺的行为，总觉得那只是建立在一种不确定的、不正当的权利之上，而且财富既是用暴力得来，也能被人用暴力夺去，他们是没有任何理由可以抱怨的。即使那些全凭自己的勤劳而致富的人们，也几乎不能为他们的财产所有权找到更好的根据。他们尽管说：“这道墙是我修建的，这块土地是凭我的劳动得来的。”人们可以反问：“请问，你占地的界限是谁指定的呢？我们并没有强使你劳动，你凭什么要我们来负担你劳动的报酬呢？有无数同胞，因为缺乏你所拥有的过多的东西而死亡、而受苦，难道你不知道吗？在人类公有的生活资料中，你把超过维持你自己的生存所需要的部分据为己有，就应该取得全人类明示的和一致的同意，难道你还不知道么？”富人没有为自己辩护的有力的理由和足以自卫的力量；他虽然很容易制服某一个人，却会被成群的前来抢劫他的财产的人们所制服。富人是以一人对抗全体的，由于富人与富人之间的相互嫉妒，因之他们不能联合起来对抗那些因抢劫的共同愿望而结合起来的敌人。为情势所迫，富人终于想出了一种最深谋远虑的计划，这种计划是前人从来没有想到过的，那就是：利用那些攻击自己的人们的力量来为自己服务，把自己原来的敌人变成自己的保卫者，并向他们灌输一些新的格言，为他们建立一些新的制度，这些制度对富人之有利正如同自然法对富人之有害是一样。

With this end in mind, after having shown his neighbors the horror of a situation that armed them all against each other and made their possessions as burdensome as their needs, and in which no one could find safety in either poverty or wealth, he easily invented specious reasons to lead them to his goal. “Let us unite,” he says to them, “in order to protect the weak from oppression, restrain the ambitious, and assure everyone of possessing what belongs to him. Let us institute rules of justice and peace to which all will be obliged to conform, which will make special exceptions for no one, and which will in some way compensate for the caprices of fortune by subjecting the strong and the weak to mutual obligations. In short, instead of turning our forces against ourselves, let us gather them into one supreme power that governs us according to wise laws, that protects and defends all the members of the association, repulses common enemies, and maintains us in an eternal concord.” 

Considerably less than the equivalent of this discourse was needed to convince crude, easily seduced men who also had too many disputes to settle among themselves to be able to get along without arbiters, and too much greed and ambition to be able to get along without masters for long. They all ran to chain themselves, in the belief that they secured their liberty, for although they had enough sense to realize the advantages of a political establishment, they did not have enough experience to foresee its dangers. Those most capable of anticipating the abuses were precisely those who counted on profiting from them; and even the wise saw the need to be resolved to sacrifice one part of their liberty to preserve the other, just as a wounded man has his arm amputated to save the rest of his body. 
>在这种目的下，富人向他的邻人们述说一种可怕的情势：如果所有的人彼此都武装起来相对抗，就会使某些人的富有和另一些人的贫穷，都变成了沉重的负担，无论是在贫穷或在富有之中，任何人都得不到安宁。在述说了这种情势之后，富人就很容易地造出一些动听的理由，诱导他们来达到自己的目的。他向他们说：“咱们联合起来吧，好保障弱者不受压迫，约束有野心的人，保证每个人都能占有属于他自己的东西。因此，我们要创立一种不偏袒任何人的、人人都须遵守的维护公正与和平的规则。这种规则使强者和弱者同样尽相互间的义务，以便在某种程度上，补偿命运的不齐。总之，不要用我们的力量来和我们自己作对，而要把我们的力量集结成一个至高无上的权力，这个权力根据明智的法律来治理我们，以保卫所有这一团体中的成员，防御共同的敌人，使我们生活在永久的和睦之中。”其实，无须说这么多话就足以诱惑那些容易受骗的粗野的人了，何况他们之间，有很多纠纷需要解决，不能没有评断是非的人；他们又有过大的贪婪和野心，也不能长期没有主人。于是大家都前去迎接他们的枷锁，相信它可以保障他们的自由。因为人们有足够的理智来觉察一种政治制度的好处，却没有足够的经验来预见政治制度的危险。而最能预见弊窦的人，恰恰是指望从弊窦中获取利益的人；而且，就是那些明智的人，也认为应该决心牺牲他们的一部分自由，以保存另一部分自由，如同一个负伤的人把一只臂膀割掉，来保全身体的其余部分一样。

Such was, or should have been, the origin of society and laws, which gave new fetters to the weak and new forces to the rich, xviii irretrievably destroyed natural liberty, established forever the law of property and of inequality, changed adroit usurpation into an irrevocable right, and for the profit of a few ambitious men henceforth subjected the entire human race to labor, servitude, and misery. It is readily apparent how the establishment of a single society rendered indispensable that of all the others, and how, to stand head to head against the united forces, it was necessary to unite in turn. Societies, multiplying or spreading rapidly, soon covered the entire surface of the earth; and it was no longer possible to find a single corner in the universe where someone could free himself from the yoke and withdraw his head from the often ill-guided sword that everyone saw perpetually hanging over his own head. With civil right thus having become the common rule of citizens, the

### 80
law of nature no longer was operative except between the various societies, when, under the name of the law of nations, it was tempered by some tacit conventions in order to make intercourse possible and to serve as a substitute for natural compassion which, losing between one society and another nearly all the force it once had between one man and another, no longer resides anywhere but in a few great cosmopolitan souls, who overcome the imaginary barriers that separate peoples, and who, following the example of the sovereign being who has created them, embrace the entire human race in their benevolence. Remaining thus among themselves in the state of nature, the bodies politic soon experienced the inconveniences that had forced private individuals to leave it; and that state became even more deadly among these great bodies than it had been among the private individuals of whom they were composed. Whence came the national wars, battles, murders, and reprisals that make nature tremble and offend reason, and all those horrible prejudices that rank the honor of shedding human blood among the virtues. The most decent people learned to consider it one of their duties to kill their fellowmen. Finally, men were seen massacring one another by the thousands without knowing why. More murders were committed in a single day of combat and more horrors in the capture of a single city than were committed in the state of nature during entire centuries over the entire face of the earth. Such are the first effects one glimpses of the division of mankind into different societies. Let us return to the founding of these societies. 
社会和法律就是这样或者应当是这样起源的。它们给弱者以新的桎梏，给富者以新的力量；它们永远消灭了天赋的自由，使自由再也不能恢复；它们把保障私有财产和承认不平等的法律永远确定下未，把巧取豪夺变成不可取消的权利；从此以后，便为少数野心家的利益，驱使整个人类忍受劳苦、奴役和贫困。我们很容易看出，一个社会的建立如何使其他一切社会的建立成为必要；为了对抗联合起来的力量，其余的人们如何也必须联合起来。社会很快就增多了或扩大了，不久就布满了整个地面；在世界上，人们再也找不到一个角落，能够摆脱他们的枷锁，能够避开自己头上的利剑，这个利剑因为时常操纵不当而使每个人感到永远悬在自己的头上。市民法既已成为公民的共同规则，于是自然法仅只适用于各种不同的社会之间。在各个社会之间，自然法被称为万民法，并由某些默认的协议加以调整，使社会间的交往成为可能，并使人类所失去的自然怜悯心得到补偿，因为自然怜悯心在社会与社会的关系上几乎已经丧失了它在人与人之间的关系上所具有的全部力量，现在仅只存在于一些伟大的世界主义者的心灵之中，这些世界主义者超越了那些分离各民族的臆想的障碍，他们仿照创造他们的上帝的榜样，把整个人类都包容在他们的仁爱之中。这些政治组织，在彼此之间的关系上既然还一直这样停留在自然状态之中，不久便感到种种不便，使得它们不能不摆脱这种状态；而且，这种状态存在于这些庞大的政治组织之间，比以前存在于构成这些政治组织的各个人之间，对于人类还更为不幸。由此便产生了那些震撼自然和违反理性的民族战争、残杀和报复，以及那些竟把杀人流血的荣誉列为美德的可怕偏见。最正直的人也学会了把扼杀同类当作自己的一种义务。我们终于看到成千成万的人自相残杀，而他们并不知道是为了什么。在一天的战斗中所屠杀的人；在占领一座城市时所造成的恐怖，比在自然状态中，整个地球上许多世纪内所杀害的人和所造成的恐怖还要多得多。这就是我们所见到的人类分成许多不同的社会后的最初结果。现在让我们来研究一下这些社会的成立问题。

I know that many have ascribed other origins to political societies, such as conquests by the most powerful, or the union of the weak; and the choice among these causes is indifferent to what I want to establish. Nevertheless, the one I have just described seems to me the most natural, for the following reasons. 1. In the first case, the right of conquest, since it is not a right, could not have founded any other, because the conqueror and conquered peoples always remain in a state of war with one another, unless the nation, returned to full liberty, were to choose voluntarily its conqueror as its leader. Until then, whatever the capitulations that may have been made, since they have been founded on violence alone and are consequently null by this very fact, on this hypothesis there can be neither true society nor body politic, nor any other law than that of the strongest. 2. These words strong and weak are equivocal in the second case, because in the interval between the establishment of the right of property or of the first occupant and that of political governments, the meaning of these terms is better rendered by the words poor and rich, because, before the laws, man did not in fact have any other means of placing his equals in subjection except by attacking their goods or by giving them part of his. 3. Since the poor had nothing to lose but their liberty, it would have been utter folly for them to have voluntarily surrendered the only good remaining to them, gaining nothing in return. On the contrary, since the rich men were, so to speak, sensitive in all parts of their goods, it was much easier to do them harm, and consequently they had to take greater

### 81
precautions to protect themselves. And finally it is reasonable to believe that a thing was invented by those to whom it is useful rather than by those to whom it is harmful. 
>我知道关于政治社会的起源，有许多作者还持有其他主张，例如认为起源于强者的征服，或弱者的联合；对于这些原因的选择，是与我所要证明的东西无关的。可是，我在上文所阐述的原因，在我看来是最合乎自然的，理由是：（一）在第一种情形下，所谓征服权并不是一种权利，所以不能据以创立任何其他权利；在征服者与被征服民族之间的关系上，除非被征服民族完全恢复了自由，自愿选择它的征服者作自己的首领，他们二者便永远处于战争状态。在此以前，无论订立了什么样的投降条约，这些条约既然仅以暴力为基础，这一事实本身就注定了这条约是无效的。所以在这种假定上，既不可能有真正的社会，也不可能有政治组织，除强者的权力外，也不可能有其他的法律。（二）在第二种情形下，强和弱这两个字的意义是暧昧不明的，在所有权或先占者的权利的设定与政治统治的建立之间的过渡时期，这两个字的意义倒不如用·贫和·富两个字来表达更为恰当。因为，实际上，在有法律以前，一个人要想使他的同类服从，除了袭击他们的财产，或者把自己的财产分给他们一部分以外，是没有任何（三）因为穷人除了他们的自由而外，没有什么可以失掉的东西，除非他们完全丧失了理智，绝不会毫无代价地自愿抛弃他们所仅存的唯一所有物。相反地，可以说富人对自己财产的每一部分都是敏感的，要使富人受损害，那是极其容易的事；因此，富人对于自己的财产必须采取一些安全的措施；总之，我们认为一种制度，与其说是对他有害的人所发明的，不如说是对他有利的人所发明的，这才是比较合理的。

Incipient government did not have a constant and regular form. The lack of philosophy and experience permitted only present inconveniences to be perceived, and there was thought of remedying the others only as they presented themselves. Despite all the labors of the wisest legislators, the political state always remained imperfect, because it was practically the work of chance and, because it had been badly begun, time, in discovering faults and suggesting remedies, could never repair the vices of the constitution. People were continually patching it up, whereas they should have begun by clearing the air and putting aside all the old materials, as Lycurgus did in Sparta, in order to raise a good edifice later on. At first, society consisted merely of some general conventions that all private individuals promised to observe, and concerning which the community became the guarantor for each of them. Experience had to demonstrate how weak such a constitution was, and how easy it was for lawbreakers to escape conviction or punishment for faults of which the public alone was to be witness and judge. The law had to be evaded in a thousand ways; inconveniences and disorders had to multiply continually in order to make them finally give some thought to confiding to private individuals the dangerous trust of public authority, and to make them entrust to magistrates the care of enforcing the observance of the deliberations of the people. For to say that the leaders were chosen before the confederation was brought about and that the ministers of the laws existed before the laws themselves is a supposition that does not allow of serious debate. 
>新产生的统治机构毫无固定的和正规的形式。哲学和经验的缺乏，使人只能觉察到目前的不便；至于其他的不便，人们只在它们出现的时候，才会想到加以纠正。尽管有最贤明的立法者尽了一切努力，政治状态总是不完善的，因为它几乎是一种偶然的产物。而且因为它开始就不健全，时间虽能使人发现它的缺点而提出一些挽救方法，但却永远不能补救组织本身的缺陷。人们只是继续不断地加以改善，其实他们应当象来喀古士在斯巴达所作的那样，首先扫清地面并抛弃一切陈旧的材料，以便从新建造一座美好的大厦。社会起初不过是由一些一般公约组织起来的；所有成员对这些公约都约定遵守，并由共同体对每一个成员负保证之责。只有经验证明了这样一个组织是多么脆弱，以及违犯公约的人又多么容易逃避所犯过错的认定和惩罚——因为他的过错只有公众才能作证和加以裁判——的时候；只有人们千方百计地逃避法律的时候；只有不便和混乱继续不断地增多的时候，人们才终于想到把公共权力冒险地委托给私人，才把执行人民决议的任务委托给官吏。因为如果说人们在结盟以前，就已经选出了首领，如果说在有法律以前就已经有了法律执行者，这乃是一种无须认真加以辩驳的假设。

It would be no more reasonable to believe that initially the peoples threw themselves unconditionally and for all time into the arms of an absolute master, and that the first means of providing for the common security dreamed up by proud and unruly men was to rush headlong into slavery. In fact, why did they give themselves over to superiors, if not to defend themselves against oppression and to protect their goods, their liberties, and their lives, which are, as it were, the constitutive elements of their being? Now, since, in relations between men, the worst that can happen to someone is for him to see himself at the discretion of someone else, would it not have been contrary to good sense to begin by surrendering into the hands of a leader the only things for whose preservation they needed his help?[51] What equivalent could he have offered them for the concession of so fine a right? And if he had dared to demand it on the pretext of defending them, would he not have immediately received the reply given in the fable: “What more will the enemy do

to us?”[52] It is therefore incontestable, and it is a fundamental maxim of all political right, that peoples have given themselves leaders in order to defend their liberty and not to enslave themselves. “If we have a prince,” Pliny said to Trajan, “it is so that he may preserve us from having a master.”[53] 
>然而，如果认为人民一开始就会无条件地、永远地投入一个专制主人的怀抱，认为无所畏惧的和未经驯服的人们所想到的第一个维护公共安全的方法就是投身于奴隶制，那也是不大合理的。事实上，如果不是为了防止受压迫，不是为了保护可以说构成他们生存要素的财产、自由和生命，他们为什么要给自己找出一个统治者呢？而且，在人与人的关系上，一个人所能遭到的最大不幸，就是看到自己受另一个人的任意支配，如果一个人为了保存他仅有的这些东西才需要首领的援助，他却一开始就自愿地放弃了这些仅有的东西而把它们交给一个首领，这岂不是违背常识吗？对于如此宝贵的权利的让与，首领能给他们以什么相等的代价呢？如果他以保护他们为借口，竟敢强求这种权利的让与，他们立刻就会以讽刺的口吻回答他说：“敌人对我们也不过如此吧！”人民之所以要有首领，乃是为了保卫自己的自由，而不是为了使自己受奴役，这是无可争辩的事实，同时也是全部政治法的基本准则。普林尼曾对图画真说：我们所以拥戴一个国王，为的是他能保证我们不作任何主人的奴隶。

political theorists produce the same sophisms about the love of liberty that philosophers have produced about the state of nature. On the basis of the things they see they make judgments about very different things they have not seen; and they attribute to men a natural inclination to servitude owing to the patience with which those who are before their eyes endure their servitude, without giving a thought to the fact that it is the same for liberty as it is for innocence and virtue: their value is felt only as long as one has them oneself, and the taste for them is lost as soon as one has lost them. “I know the delights of your country,” said Brasidas to a satrap who compared the life of Sparta to that of Persepolis, “but you cannot know the pleasures of mine.”[54] 
>我们的政治家们关于爱好自由所作的那些诡辩和哲学家们关于自然状态所作的那些诡辩是一样的。他们根据自己曾经见过的事物，判断他们未曾见过的极不相同的事物。他们因为看到一些人耐心忍受奴役，便认为人们有一种忍受奴役的天然倾向。他们没有想到，自由也和天真与美德一样，人们只有在亲自享受的时候才感觉到它们的价值，一旦丧失了它们，便也丧失了对于它们的兴趣。布拉西达斯对一位把波斯波里斯城的生活同斯巴达的生活相比较的波斯总督说：“我知道你的故乡的幸福，你却不会知道我的故乡的快乐。”

As an unbroken steed bristles his mane, paws the ground with his hoof, and struggles violently at the mere approach of the bit, while a trained horse patiently endures the whip and the spur, barbarous man does not bow his head for the yoke that civilized man wears without a murmur, and he prefers the most stormy liberty to tranquil subjection. Thus it is not by the degradation of enslaved peoples that man’s natural dispositions for or against servitude are to be judged, but by the wonders that all free peoples have accomplished to safeguard themselves from oppression. I know that enslaved peoples do nothing but boast of the peace and tranquility they enjoy in their chains and that “they give the name ‘peace’ to the most miserable slavery.”[55] But when I see free peoples sacrificing pleasures, tranquility, wealth, power, and life itself for the preservation of this sole good which is regarded so disdainfully by those who have lost it; when I see animals born free and abhorring captivity break their heads against the bars of their prison; when I see multitudes of utterly naked savages scorn European pleasures and brave hunger, fire, sword, and death, simply to preserve their independence, I sense that it is inappropriate for slaves to reason about liberty. 
>文明人毫无怨声地带着他的枷锁，野蛮人则决不肯向枷锁低头，而且，他宁愿在风暴中享自由，不愿在安宁中受奴役；正如一匹被驯服了的马，耐心地忍受着鞭策和踢马刺，而一匹未驯服的马则一接近马缰辔就竖起鬣毛，用蹄击地，激烈地抗拒。所以，不应当根据被奴役的人民的堕落状态，而应当根据一切自由民族为抵抗压迫而作出的惊人事迹来判断人的天性是倾向奴役或反对奴役。我知道前一种人只是不断地夸耀他们在枷锁下所享受的和平和安宁，其实他们是把最悲惨的奴隶状态称为和平。但是，当我看到后一种人宁肯牺牲快乐、安宁、财富、权力、甚至生命来保存他们这项唯一的财产——也就是丧失了这项财产的人那么藐视的财产——的时候；当我看到生来自由的一些野兽，因憎恨束缚向牢笼栏干撞坏了头的时候；当我看到成千成万的赤裸裸的野蛮人，鄙视欧洲人的淫逸生活，只为保存他们的独立自主而甘冒饥饿、炮火、刀剑和死亡的危险的时候，我感到讨论“自由”的问题，并不是奴隶们的事情。

As for paternal authority, from which several have derived absolute government and all society, it is enough, without having recourse to the contrary proofs of Locke and Sidney, to note that nothing in the world is farther from the ferocious spirit of despotism than the gentleness of that authority which looks more to the advantage of the one who obeys than to the utility of the

one who commands; that by the law of nature, the father is master of the child as long as his help is necessary for him; that beyond this point they become equals, and the son, completely independent of the father, then owes him merely respect and not obedience; for gratitude is clearly a duty that must be rendered, but not a right that can be demanded. 56 Instead of saying that civil society derives from paternal power, on the contrary it must be said that it is from civil society that this power draws its principal force. An individual was not recognized as the father of several children until the children remained gathered about him. The goods of the father, of which he is truly the master, are the goods that keep his children in a state of dependence toward him, and he can decide that any share they receive of his estate reflects the extent to which they will have merited it from him by continuous deference to his wishes. Now, far from having some similar favor to expect from their despot (since they belong to him as personal possessions— they and all they possess— or at least he claims this to be the case), subjects are reduced to receiving as a favor what he leaves them of their goods. He does what is just when he despoils them; he does them a favor when he allows them to live. 
>至于父权，许多学者认为专制政治和整个社会都是由父权派生出来的，我们用不着援引洛克和锡得尼相反的论证，只须指明以下几点就够了：世界上没有比父权的温和与专制政治的残暴更相径庭的了，因为父权的行使与其说是为了命令者的利益，毋宁说是为了服从者的利益。依照自然法，父亲只是在他的子女还需要他的扶助的时候，他才是子女的主人。过了这个时期，他们便处于同等的地位了，子女完全脱离父亲而独立，对父亲只有尊敬的义务而没有服从的义务，因为报恩只是一种应尽的义务，而不是一种可以强求的权利。因此，我们不能说文明社会是从父权派生出来的，相反地，却应该说父权是从文明社会汲取了它的主要的力量。一个人只是在子女们聚居在他的周围的时候，才能被认为是这些子女的父亲。父亲的财产——他仅只是他的财产的真正主人——乃是保持其子女对他的从属关系的纽带。他可以根据每个子女是否经常遵从他的意志克尽孝道来决定每人所应继承的部分。至于臣民对于暴君，则不能期待任何类似的恩惠，因为臣民自身及其一切都属于暴君所有，或者至少暴君自己认为是如此，所以当暴君把臣民自己的一些财产留给他们的时候，他们还不得不把它当作一种恩惠来接受。暴君剥夺臣民，算是公正；暴君让臣民活着，算是施恩。

If we continued thus to examine the facts from the viewpoint of right, no more solidity than truth would be found in the belief that the establishment of tyranny was voluntary; and it would be difficult to show the validity of a contract that would obligate only one of the parties, where all the commitments would be placed on one side with none on the other, and that would turn exclusively to the disadvantage of the one making the commitments. This odious system is quite far removed from being, even today, that of wise and good monarchs, and especially of the kings of France, as may be seen in various places in their edicts, and particularly in the following passage of a famous writing published in 1667 in the name of and by order of Louis XIV: “Let it not be said therefore that the sovereign is not subject to the laws of his state, for the contrary statement is a truth of the law of nations, which flattery has on occasion attacked, but which good princes have always defended as a tutelary divinity of their states. How much more legitimate is it to say, with the wise Plato, that the perfect felicity of a kingdom is that a prince be obeyed by his subjects, that the prince obey the law, and that the law be right and always directed to the public good.” I will not stop to investigate whether, with liberty being the most noble of man’s faculties, he degrades his nature, places himself on the level of animals enslaved by instinct, offends even his maker, when he unreservedly renounces the most precious of all God’s gifts, and allows himself to commit all the crimes He forbids us to commit, in order to please a ferocious or crazed master; nor whether this sublime workman should be more irritated at seeing His finest work destroyed rather than at seeing it dishonored.

who flatly declares, following Locke, that no one can sell his liberty to the point of submitting himself to an arbitrary power that treats him according to its fancy. For, he adds, “this would be selling his own life, of which he is not the master.” [57] I will merely ask by what right those who have not been afraid of debasing themselves to this degree have been able to subject their posterity to the same ignominy and to renounce for it goods that do not depend on their own liberality, and without which life itself is burdensome to all who are worthy of it.
>如果我们这样从权利出发来继续研究这些事实，我们就会发现专制政治的建立出于人民自愿之说，既无可靠的根据，也缺乏真实性。如果一种契约只拘束当事人的一方，一切义务都由一方来负担，他方毫无负担，而受损害的恰恰是负担义务的人，那么，要证明这种契约的效力是非常困难的。这种极不合理的制度，即在今日的贤明善良的君主的制度，尤其是法兰西国王的制度，也远非如此。我们可以在他们颁布的敕令中许多地方看到这一点，特别是在１６６７年用路易十四的名义并根据他的命令刊行的一部名著中，我们可以读到这样一段文字：因此，我们决不应当说君主可以不受他本国法律的支配，因为与此相反的命题乃是万民法上的一条真理，虽然这条真理有时为阿谀者所攻击，但贤明的国王总是象国家的保护神一样来保护这一真理。我们如果也象明智的柏拉图那样地说：一个王国的完美无缺的幸福在于臣民服从国王，国王服从法律，而法律是公正的，并且永远面向公众的幸福，那是多么更为合理啊！我不想停下笔来研究这一问题：自由既是人的一切能力中最崇卢梭在巴尔贝拉克著作里找到这段引文。巴尔贝拉克是赞成普芬道夫而反对霍布斯的，他主张国王本人也应服从国家的根本法。高的能力，如果为了取媚于一个残暴的或疯狂的主人，竟毫无保留地抛弃他所有天赋中最宝贵的天赋，竟屈从主人的意旨去犯造物主禁止我们去犯的一切罪恶，这是不是使人类的天性堕落，把自己置于完全受本能支配的那些禽兽水平上？甚至是不是对自己的存在的创造者的一种侮辱？这个崇高的造物主看到他的最美的创造物遭到毁灭应当比看到他的最美的创造物受到侮辱更为愤怒。如果人们愿意，我就不详细论述巴尔贝拉克的权威说法。巴尔贝拉克根据洛克的看法，曾直截了当地表明：任何人不能出卖自己的自由，竟使自己受专制权力的任意支配。他接着说道：因为出卖自由就等于出卖自己的生命，而任何人都不是自己生命的主人。我所要知道的仅只是：不怕把自己贬低到这种程度的人们，有什么权利使他们的后裔也受同样的屈辱，并代替自己的后裔放弃那些并非由于他们的赐与而获得的幸福？对于一切理应享受这些幸福的人们来说，若是没有这些幸福，则生命本身就成为一种负担了。

Pufendorf says that just as one transfers one’s goods to another by conventions and contracts, one can also divest oneself of one’s liberty in favor of someone else. 58 That, it seems to me, is very bad reasoning; for, in the first place, the goods I give away become something utterly foreign to me, and it is a matter of indifference to me whether or not these goods are abused; but it is important to me that my liberty is not abused, and I cannot expose myself to becoming the instrument of crime without making myself guilty of the evil I will be forced to commit. Moreover, since the right of property is merely the result of convention and human institution, every man can dispose of what he possesses as he sees fit. But it is not the same for the essential gifts of nature such as life and liberty, which everyone is allowed to enjoy, and of which it is at least doubtful that one has the right to divest oneself. In giving up liberty one degrades one’s being; in giving up life one annihilates that being insofar as one can. And because no temporal goods can compensate for the one or the other, it would offend at the same time both nature and reason to renounce them, regardless of the price. But even if one could give away one’s liberty as one does one’s goods, the difference would be very great for the children who enjoy the father’s goods only by virtue of a transmission of his right; whereas, since liberty is a gift they receive from nature in virtue of being men, their parents had no right to divest them of it. Thus, just as violence had to be done to nature in order to establish slavery, nature had to be changed in order to perpetuate this right. And the jurists, who have gravely pronounced that the child of a slave woman is born a slave, have decided, in other words, that a man is not born a man. 
> 普芬道夫说，人既可以根据协议与契约把自己的财产让与别人，同样也可以为了有利于某人而抛弃自己的自由。我认为这是一种非常拙劣的推理。因为，首先，我把财产让与别人以后，这项财产就变成完全与我无关的东西了，如果别人滥用它，也与我不相干；但是，人们要滥用我的自由，则不能与我无关，因为，我不能去冒那种使自己成为犯罪工具的危险，而又不使自己成为别人强迫我所犯罪恶的罪人。此外，所有权不过是一种协议和人为的制度，因此人人能够随意处分他所有的东西。但是，人类主要的天然禀赋，生命和自由，则不能与此相提并论，这些天赋人人可以享受，至于是否自己有权抛弃，这至少是值得怀疑的。一个人抛弃了自由，便贬低了自己的存在，抛弃了生命，便完全消灭了自己的存在。因为任何物质财富都不能抵偿这两种东西，所以无论以任何代价抛弃生命和自由，都是既违反自然同时也违反理性的。而且，纵使人们能象让与财产那样，把自由让与别人，但对子女们来说，这两者之间的区别也是很大的。子女们享受父亲的财产，只是由父亲的权利移转而来的；而自由乃是他们以人的资格从自然方面所获得的禀赋，父母没有任何权利剥夺他们这种天然禀赋。那么，为了建立奴隶制，就必须违犯自然，同样地，为了使这种权利永存下去，就必须变更自然。法学家们既郑重宣布了奴隶的孩子生下来就是奴隶，换句话说，他们也就肯定了人生下来就不是人。

Thus it appears certain to me not only that governments did not begin with arbitrary power, which is but their corruption and extreme limit, and which finally brings them back simply to the law of the strongest, for which they were initially to have been the remedy; but also that even if they had begun thus, this power, being illegitimate by its nature, could not have served as a foundation for the rights of society, nor, as a consequence, for the inequality occasioned by social institutions. 
>所以，我认为可以肯定：政府并不是从专制权力开始的。专制权力只不过是政府腐化的结果，是政府的终极点，它使政府又返回到最强者的权力上，而最初政府的建立乃是对最强者的权力的补救方法。不但如此，即使政府是从专制权力开始的，由于这种权力，按它的性质来说就是不合法的，所以不能把它作为社会上的各种权利的基础，因之也不能把它作为人为的不平等的基础。

Without entering at present into the investigations that are yet to be made into the nature of the fundamental compact of all government,[59] I restrict myself, in following common opinion, to considering here the establishment of the body politic as a true contract between the populace and the leaders it chooses for itself: a contract by which the two parties obligate themselves to observe the laws that are stipulated in it and that form the bonds of their union. Since, with respect to social relations, the populace has united all its wills into a single one, all the articles in which this will is explicated become so many fundamental laws obligating all the members of the state without exception, and one of these regulates the choice and power of the magistrates charged with watching over the execution of the others. This power extends to everything that can maintain the constitution, without going so far as to change it. To it are joined honors that make the laws and their ministers worthy of respect, and, for the ministers personally, prerogatives that compensate them for the troublesome labors that a good administration requires. The magistrate, for his part, obligates himself to use the power entrusted to him only in accordance with the intention of the constituents, to maintain each one in the peaceful enjoyment of what belongs to him, and to prefer on every occasion the public utility to his own interest. 
>关于一切政府的基本契约的性质，本是尚待探讨的问题，但我们今天暂不深入研究。我只依照一般意见，把政治组织的建立视为人民和他们所选出的首领之间的一种真正的契约，双方约定遵守其中规定的法律，这些法律构成了他们结合的纽带。人民在一切社会关系上，既已把他们每个人的意志结合成为一个单一的意志，所以一切表现这个意志的条款，同时也就成为对于国家全体成员无不具有拘束力的根本法。这些根本法之一并规定着负责监督执行其他各项法律的官员的选任和权力。这种权力可以包括维持宪法所需要的一切职权，但不能涉及宪法的变更。此外，人们还规定了一些使法律和执行法律的官员受到尊重的有关荣誉的条款，并给他们本人一些特权以报偿他们为把国家管理好所需要从事的艰苦工作。在官员方面，他们则负有以下的义务：他们必须按照委托人的意思行使所受托的权力，必须维护每个人能以安全地享受他所有的一切，而且必须在任何情形下都把公共利益放在个人利益之上。

Before experience had shown or knowledge of the human heart had made men foresee the inevitable abuses of such a constitution, it must have seemed all the better because those who were charged with watching over its preservation were themselves the ones who had the greatest interest in it. For since the magistracy and its rights were established exclusively on fundamental laws, were they to be destroyed, the magistracy would immediately cease to be legitimate; the people would no longer be bound to obey them. And since it was not the magistrate but the law that had constituted the essence of the state, everyone would rightfully return to his natural liberty. 
>在经验还没有证明，或者说在人类的知识还没有使人预见到这样一种宪法不可避免的流弊以前，这一宪法应当是较好的宪法，因为负责维护这一宪法的人们自己就与宪法的保存有最密切的利害关系。官职的设置和官员的权利既以根本法为唯一依据，因之，根本法一被破坏，官员们就丧失了他们的合法地位，人民就没有再服从他们的义务。而且因为国家构成的基本要素不是官员而是法律，所以每个人就当然恢复了他天赋的自由。

The slightest attentive reflection on this point would confirm this by new reasons, and by the nature of the contract it would be seen that it could not be irrevocable. For were there no superior power that could guarantee the fidelity of the contracting parties or force them to fulfill their reciprocal commitments, the parties would remain sole judges in their own case, and each of them would always have the right to renounce the contract as soon as he should find that the other party violated the conditions of the contract, or as soon as the conditions should cease to suit him. It is on this principle that it appears the right to abdicate can be founded. Now to consider, as we are doing, only what is of human institution, if the magistrate, who has all the power in his hands and who appropriates to himself all the advantages of the contract, nevertheless had the right to renounce his authority, a fortiori the populace, which pays for all the faults of the leaders, should have the right to renounce their dependence. But the horrible dissensions, the infinite

disorders that this dangerous power would necessarily bring in its wake, demonstrate more than anything else how much need human governments had for a basis more solid than reason alone, and how necessary it was for public tranquility that the divine will intervened to give to sovereign authority a sacred and inviolable character which took from the subjects the fatal right to dispose of it. If religion had brought about this good for men, it would be enough to oblige them to cherish and adopt it, even with its abuses, since it spares even more blood than fanaticism causes to be shed. But let us follow the thread of our hypothesis. 
>只要我们稍微仔细考虑一下，以上所说的这一点就可以被一些新的论剧所证实；而且就契约的性质而论，我们也可以看出这种契约并不是不可以取消的。因为，如果没有更高的权力来保证缔约者的信守不渝，来强使他们履行相互间的允诺，缔约双方仍然是他们自己的讼争的唯一裁判者，那么，两造中的一造一旦发现对方违背了契约的条款或者那些条款对他不再适合的时候，他就随时有抛弃契约的权利。很可能，弃权的权利就是以这种原理为根据的。然而，我们现在所要研究的就是在于考察人类的制度，不难了解，假如掌握一切权力的并把契约的一切利益都据为己有的官员们有抛弃职权的权利，那么，因首长们的错误措施而受到损害的人民就更应当有抛弃从属关系的权利了。但是，这种危险的权利必然会引起可怕的纷争和无穷的混乱。这些纷争和混乱适足以说明：人类的政治组织是多么需要比单纯的理性更为坚固的基础；并且为了公共的安宁，是多么需要神意的参与，以便给予最高权力以一种神圣不可侵犯的性质，从而可以剥夺臣民对于最高权力这种不幸的自由处分的权利。宗教即便有它的弊端，只要对人们作这样一件有益的事情，便足以使人们热爱它而且皈依它，因为它节省下来的人类的血，多于因宗教狂热病而流出的血。但是我们还是沿着我们假定的线索继续探讨下去。

The various forms of government take their origin from the greater or lesser differences that were found among private individuals at the moment of institution. If a man were eminent in power, virtue, wealth, or prestige, he alone was elected magistrate, and the state became monarchical. If several men, more or less equal among themselves, stood out over all the others, they were elected jointly, and there was an aristocracy. Those whose fortune or talents were less disproportionate, and who least departed from the state of nature, kept the supreme administration and formed a democracy. Time made evident which of these forms was the most advantageous to men. Some remained in subjection only to the laws; the others soon obeyed masters. Citizens wanted to keep their liberty; the subjects thought only of taking it away from their neighbors, since they could not endure others enjoying a good they themselves no longer enjoyed. In a word, on the one hand were riches and conquests, and on the other were happiness and virtue. 
>政府的各种不同的形式，是由政府成立时存在于个人之间或大或小的差异而产生的。如果有一个人在能力、道德、财富或声望上都是卓越的，而他独自被选为长官，那么，这个国家便成为君主政体的国家。如果有一些彼此不相上下的人，他们都高出别人一等，而一齐被选，那么，这个国家便成为贵族政体的国家。如果人们的财产或才能并不是那么不平均，而他们距离自然状态又并不很远，那么，他们便共同保持着最高的行政而组成民主政体的国家。时间已经证明了各种政体中哪一种政体是最有利于人类的。某一些人始终仅只服从于法律；而另一些人不久便听命于主人。公民们希望保持他们的自由；而臣民们由于不能容忍别人享受他们自己已经享受不到的幸福，所以他们只想剥夺他们邻人的自由。总之，一方面是财富和征服，另一方面则是幸福和美德。

In these various forms of government all the magistratures were at first elective; and when wealth did not prevail, preference was given to merit, which gives a natural ascendancy, and to age, which gives experience in conducting business and cool-headedness in deliberation. The elders of the Hebrews, the gerontes of Sparta, the senate of Rome, and even the etymology of our word seigneur show how much age was respected in former times. The more elections fell upon men of advanced age, the more frequent elections became, and the more their difficulties were made to be felt. Intrigues were introduced; factions were formed; parties became embittered; civil wars flared up. Finally, the blood of citizens was sacrificed to the alleged happiness of the state, and people were on the verge of falling back into the anarchy of earlier times. The ambition of the leaders profited from these circumstances to perpetuate their offices within their families. The people, already accustomed to dependence, tranquility, and the conveniences of life, and already incapable of breaking their chains, consented to let their servitude increase in order to secure their tranquility. Thus it was that the leaders, having become hereditary, grew accustomed to regard their magistratures as family property, to regard themselves as the proprietors of the state (of which at first they were but the officers), to call their fellow citizens their slaves, to count them, like cattle, in the number of things that belonged to them, and to call themselves equals of the gods and kings of kings.
>在上述各种不同的政体中，一切官员最初都是由选举产生的。当一个人的财产条件不比别人优越时，人们所以选举他，是根据他的功绩，因为功绩给人以自然的威望；同时也根据他的年龄，因为年长的人处理事务富有经验，议决事情头脑冷静。希伯来人的“长者”，斯巴达的“元老”，罗马的“元老院”，甚至我们所谓领主一词的字源上的意义，都指明在从前年老是如何受人尊敬。越是老年人当选，选举就越频繁，也就越使人觉得麻烦。于是阴谋发生了、派系形成了、党派的冲突尖锐化了、内战的火焰燃起了；公民的生命终于为所谓国家的幸福而牺牲。人们于是又处于从前那种无政府状态的前夕。有野心的权贵们，往往利用这种情况，把职位永远把持在自己家族之手。人民已经习惯于依附、安宁、和生活的安乐，再也不能摆脱身上的枷锁；为了确保自己的安宁，他们甘愿让人加重对自己的奴役。这样，已经成为世袭的首领们，就逐渐习惯于把官爵看作自己的家产，把自己看作是国家的所有主，而起初他们只不过是国家的官史。这样，他们也就习惯于把他们的同胞叫作奴隶，把这些奴隶当牲畜一样算在他们的财产的数目之内，而自称是与神齐等的王中之王。

### 87
If we follow the progress of inequality in these various revolutions, we will find that the first stage was the establishment of the law and of the right of property, the second stage was the institution of the magistracy, and the third and final stage was the transformation of legitimate power into arbitrary power. Thus the condition of rich and poor was authorized by the first epoch, that of the strong and the weak by the second, and that of master and slave by the third: the ultimate degree of inequality and the limit to which all the others finally lead, until new revolutions completely dissolve the government or bring it nearer to a legitimate institution. 
>如果我们从这些各种不同的变革中观察不平等的进展，我们便会发现法律和私有财产权的设定是不平等的第一阶段；官职的设置是第二阶段；而第三阶段，也就是最末一个阶段，是合法的权力变成专制的权力。因此，富人和穷人的状态是为第一个时期所认可的；强者和弱者的状态是为第二个时期所认可的；主人和奴隶的状态是为第三个时期所认可的。这后一状态乃是不平等的顶点，也是其他各个阶段所终于要达到的阶段，直到新的变革使政府完全瓦解，或者使它再接近于合法的制度为止。

To grasp the necessity of this progression, we must consider less the motives for the establishment of the body politic than the form it takes in its implementation and the disadvantages that follow in its wake. For the vices that make social institutions necessary are the same ones that make their abuses inevitable. And with the sole exception of Sparta, where the law kept watch chiefly over the education of children, and where Lycurgus established mores that nearly dispensed with having to add laws to them, since laws are generally less strong than passions and restrain men without changing them, it would be easy to prove that any government that always operated in conformity with the purpose for which it was founded without being corrupted or altered, would have been needlessly instituted, and that a country where no one eluded the laws and abused the magistrature would need neither magistracy nor laws. 
>为要了解这种进展的必然性，与其说应当考察设立政治组织的动机，不如说应当考察它在实际上所采取的形式，和那些随之而来的种种不便。因为使社会制度成为必要的那些缺点，同时也就是使社会制度的滥用成为不可避免的那些缺点。姑且不谈斯巴达这唯一的例外情形——在斯巴达，法律所关切的主要是儿童教育，来喀古士在那里并树立了无须用法律来辅助的道德风气——因为法律一般说来是弱于情欲，只能约束人而不能改变人，所以不难证明：任何一个政府，假如它不腐化、不败坏，总是严格遵循着它所负的使命前进，那末，这个政府就没有设立的必要。在一个国家里，如果任何人都不规避法律，任何官员都不滥用职权，那末，这个国家就既不需要官员也不需要法律。

Political distinctions necessarily lend themselves to civil distinctions. The growing inequality between the people and its leaders soon makes itself felt among private individuals, and is modified by them in a thousand ways according to passions, talents, and events. The magistrate cannot usurp illegitimate power without surrounding himself with hangers-on to whom he is forced to yield some part of it. Moreover, citizens allow themselves to be oppressed only insofar as they are driven by blind ambition; and looking more below than above them, domination becomes more dear to them than independence, and they consent to wear chains in order to be able to give them in turn to others. It is very difficult to reduce to obedience someone who does not seek to command; and the most adroit politician would never succeed in subjecting men who wanted merely to be free. But inequality spreads easily among ambitious and cowardly souls always ready to run the risks of fortune and who scarcely care whether they dominate or serve, depending on whether fortune is with them or against them. Thus it is that there must have come a time when the eyes of the people were beguiled to such an extent that its leaders merely had to say to the humblest of men, “Be great, you and all your progeny,” and he immediately appeared great to everyone as well as in his own eyes, and his descendants were elevated even more in proportion as they were at some remove from him. The more remote and uncertain the cause, the more the effect increased; the more loafers one could count in a family, the more illustrious it became.
>政治上的差别，必然会引起社会上人民间的差别。在人民与其首长之间日益增长着的不平等，不久在个人与个人之间也显示出来了，并且因欲望、才能和境遇的不同而形成千百种不同的表现形态。当权的官员若不安置一群肖小，并把一部分权力分给他们，就不可能篡夺非法的权力。而且，公民们也只是在一种盲目的贪心引诱之下，才会受人压迫。他们宁向下看，而不往上看，因此，在他们看来，统治别人比不依附于人更为可贵。他们同意戴上枷锁，为的是反转来能把枷锁套在别人身上。很难强使一个决不好命令他人的人去服从别人；最有智谋的政治家也不能使那些以自由为唯一愿望的人们屈服。但是不平等是很容易伸展到野心家和怯懦者之间的，因为他们随时都在准备着冒风险，准备着依时运的顺逆，或者去统治人，或者去侍奉人，这二者对他们说来，几乎是没有什么差别的。因此，就必然会出现这样一个时代，人民竟被眩惑到这样的程度，以至于只要统治者对一个最渺小的人说：“让你和你的族人，都作显贵人物吧”，他立刻就在众人面前显得尊贵起来，而且自己也觉得尊贵起来了。他的后裔和他相隔的世代愈远，便愈显得尊贵。使他们成为显贵的原因越久远和越估不透，其效果也就起大；一个家庭里无所事事的人数越多，这个家庭也就越煊赫。

If this were the place to go into detail, I would easily explain how the inequality of prestige and authority becomes inevitable among private individuals, xix as soon as they are united in one single society and are forced to make comparisons among themselves and to take into account the differences they discover in the continual use they have to make of one another. These differences are of several sorts, but in general, since wealth, nobility or rank, power, and personal merit are the principal distinctions by which someone is measured in society, I would prove that the agreement or conflict of these various forces is the surest indication of a wellor ill-constituted state. I would make it apparent that among these four types of inequality, personal qualities are the origin of all the others, but wealth is the last to which they are ultimately reduced, because, since it is the most immediately useful to well-being and the easiest to communicate, it readily serves to buy all the rest. This observation enables one to judge rather precisely the extent to which each people is removed from its primitive institution, and of the progress it has made toward the final stage of corruption. I would note how much that universal desire for reputation, honors, and privileges, which devours us all, develops and compares our talents and strengths; how much it excites and multiplies the passions; and, by making all men competitors, rivals, or rather enemies, how many setbacks, successes, and catastrophes of every sort it causes every day, by making so many contenders run the same race. I would show that it is to this ardor for making oneself the topic of conversation, to this frenzy to distinguish oneself which nearly always keeps us outside ourselves, that we owe what is best and worst among men, our virtues and vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers, that is to say, a multitude of bad things against a small number of good ones. Finally, I would prove that if one sees a handful of powerful and rich men at the height of greatness and fortune while the mob grovels in obscurity and misery, it is because the former prize the things they enjoy only to the extent that the others are deprived of them; and because, without changing their position, they would cease to be happy, if the people ceased to be miserable. 
>如果这里是应当研究细节的地方，我就不难说明这一问题：即使没有政府的干预，声望和权威的不平等，在个人与个人之间，也将是不可避免的，因为人们一结成社会，就不得不互相比较，并从他们继续不断的互相利用中注意到所发现的彼此间的差异。这些差异可分为许多种类。但是，由于通常人们主要是根据财富、爵位或等级、权势和个人功绩等方面的差异来互相评价，因此我可以证明这种种力量的协和或冲突，是一个国家组织得好坏的最可靠的标志。我可以指明，在这四种不平等中，个人的身分是其他各种不平等的根源，财富则是最后的一个。而各种不平等最后都必然会归结到财富上去。因为财富是最直接有益于幸福，又最易于转移，所以人们很容易用它来购买其余的一切。通过这种观察，我们能够确切地判断每个民族距离其原始制度的远近和走向腐败的顶点的进程。我可以指出，毁灭着我们全体的那种热衷于声望、荣誉和特权的普遍愿望，是如何在锻炼着、并使我们互相较量着我们的才能和力量；是如何在刺激着我们的欲望，并使欲望日益增多，以及如何使所有的人都相互竞争、对抗，或者勿宁说都成为仇敌，使无数有野心的人追逐于同一竞赛场上，因而每天都造成许多失败、成功和种种灾祸。我可以说明，正是由于每个人都渴望别人颂扬自己，正是由于每个人都几乎终日如疯似狂地想出人头地，才产生了人间最好和最坏的事物：我们的美德和我们的恶行；我们的科学和我们的谬误；我们的征服者和我们的哲学家；也就是说，在极少数的好事物之中有无数的坏事物。最后，我可以证明，人们所以会看见一小摄有钱有势的人达到了富贵的顶点，而群众却匍匐呻吟于黑暗和贫困之中，乃是因为前者对于他们所享有的一切，越是别人被剥夺了的东西，他们才越觉得可贵，如果情况并没有改变，只要人民不再是贫困的人，他们也就不再是幸福的人了。

But these details alone would be the subject of a large work in which one would weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of every government relative to the rights of the state of nature, and where one would examine all the different faces under which inequality has appeared until now and may appear in ages, according to the nature of these governments and the upheavals that time will necessarily bring in its wake. We would see the multitude oppressed from within as a consequence of the very precautions it had taken against what menaced it from without. We would see oppression continually increase, without the oppressed ever being able to know where it would end or what legitimate means would be left for them to stop it. We would see the rights of citizens and national liberties gradually die out, and the protests of the weak treated like seditious murmurs. We would see politics

### 89
restrict the honor of defending the common cause to a mercenary portion of the people. We would see arising from this the necessity for taxes, the discouraged farmer leaving his field, even during peacetime, and leaving his plow in order to gird himself with a sword. We would see the rise of fatal and bizarre rules in the code of honor. We would see the defenders of the homeland sooner or later become its enemies, constantly holding a dagger over their fellow citizens, and there would come a time when we would hear them say to the oppressor of their country: “If you order me to plunge my sword into my brother’s breast or my father’s throat, and into my pregnant wife’s entrails, I will do so, even though my right hand is unwilling.” [60]
>如果我们仅就以上各点详细地加以论述，便可以写成一部巨著。在这一著作里，我们可以与自然状态中的权利相对比，权衡一下各种政府的利弊。我们还可以把迄今所呈现的和在未来世纪中由于政府的性质以及时间所必然引起的变革而会呈现的不平等的各种不同形态揭露出来。我们会看到人民大众为了防御国外的威胁而采取的一系列的措施，他们在国内却被同样的措施所压迫；我们会看到这种压迫继续不断地在增长，而被压迫者永远不知道这种压迫有无尽期，也不知道为了制止这种压迫，他们还剩有什么合法的方法；我们会看到公民的权利和民族的自由逐渐在消灭，弱者的要求被看作是叛乱的怨言；我们会看到一种政策把保卫公共利益的荣誉，只限于一小部分的受雇佣的人；我们会看到，从此产生了征税的必要，在重税压迫下意志沮丧的农民即在太平年月，也甘愿离开田地，为了佩剑而放下锄头；我们会看到那些离奇的、不幸的、荣誉法规的出现；我们会看到祖国的保卫者迟早会变成祖国的敌人，不断地拿起武器指向自己的同胞；最后，会出现这样一个时期，人们可以听到他们向国内的压迫者说："如果你命令我把利剑刺入我父亲的胸膛，刺入我的怀孕的妻子的脏腑，我终于要完成你的命令，尽管我的臂膀在反抗。"

From the extreme inequality of conditions and fortunes, from the diversity of passions and talents, from useless arts, from pernicious arts, from frivolous sciences there would come a pack of prejudices equally contrary to reason, happiness, and virtue. One would see the leaders fomenting whatever can weaken men united together by disuniting them; whatever can give society an air of apparent concord while sowing the seeds of real division; whatever can inspire defiance and hatred in the various classes through the opposition of their rights and interests, and can as a consequence strengthen the power that contains them all. 

It is from the bosom of this disorder and these upheavals that despotism, by gradually raising its hideous head and devouring everything it had seen to be good and healthy in every part of the state, would eventually succeed in trampling underfoot the laws and the people, and in establishing itself on the ruins of the republic. The times that would precede this last transformation would be times of troubles and calamities; but in the end everything would be swallowed up by the monster, and the peoples would no longer have leaders or laws, but only tyrants. Also, from that moment on, there would no longer be any question of mores and virtue, for wherever despotism, “in which decency affords no hope,”[61] reigns, it tolerates no other master. As soon as it speaks, there is neither probity nor duty to consult, and the blindest obedience is the only virtue remaining for slaves. 
>>从财产和社会地位的极端不平等中；从多种多样的欲望和才能、无益或有害的技术和肤浅的科学中，产生出无数的偏见。这些偏见都是同样地违反理性、幸福和道德的。我们可以看到：凡是足以离间已经结合起来的人们，从而削弱他们的力量的那种事件；凡是足以给社会一种和睦的假象，而实际上是在散布分裂种籽的那种事件；凡是足以使各等级的人们因权利、利益的矛盾而相互猜疑和憎恨，因而有利于制服一切人并加强统治者的权力的那种事件，首领们无不在那里蓄意加以制造或煽动的。

Here is the final stage of inequality, and the extreme point that closes the circle and touches the point from which we started. Here all private individuals become equals again, because they are nothing. And since subjects no longer have any law other than the master’s will, nor the master any rule other than his passions, the notions of good and the principles of justice again vanish. Here everything is brought back to the law of the strongest, and to that alone, and consequently to a new state of nature different from the one with which we began, in that the one was the state of nature in its purity, and this last one is the fruit of an excess of corruption. Moreover, there is so little difference between these two states, and the governmental contract

is so utterly dissolved by despotism, that the despot is master only as long as he is the strongest; and as soon as he can be ousted, he has no cause to protest against violence. The uprising that ends in the strangulation or the dethronement of a sultan is as lawful an act as those by which he disposed of the lives and goods of his subjects the day before. Force alone maintained him; force alone brings him down. Thus everything happens in accordance with the natural order, and whatever the outcome of these brief and frequent upheavals may be, no one can complain about someone else’s injustice, but only of his own imprudence or his misfortune. 
>这里是不平等的顶点，这是封闭一个园圈的终极点，它和我们所由之出发的起点相遇。在这里一切个人之所以是平等的，正是因为他们都等于零。臣民除了君主的意志以外没有别的法律；君主除了他自己的欲望以外，没有别的规则。这样，善的观念，正义的原则，又重新消失了。在这里一切又都回到最强者的唯一权力上来，因而也就是回到一个新的自然状态。然而这种新的自然状态并不同于我们曾由之出发的那种自然状态，因为后者是纯洁的自然状态，而前者乃是过度腐化的结果。但是，这两种状态之间在其他方面的差别则是那么小，而且政府契约已被专制政治破坏到这种程度，以致暴君只在他是最强者的时候，才是主子；当他被驱逐的时候，他是不能抱怨暴力的。以绞杀或废除暴君为结局的起义行动，与暴君前一日任意处理臣民生命财产的行为是同样合法。暴力支持他；暴力也推翻他。一切事物都是这样按照自然的顺序进行着，无论这些短促而频繁的革命的结果如何，任何人都不能抱怨别人的不公正，他只能怨恨自己的过错或不幸。

In discovering and following thus the forgotten and lost routes that must have led man from the natural state to the civil state; in reestablishing, along with the intermediate positions I have just outlined, those which pressure of time have made me suppress or that my imagination has not suggested to me, no attentive reader can fail to be struck by the immense space that separates these two states. It is in this slow succession of things that he will see the solution to an infinity of moral and political problems that the philosophers are unable to resolve. He will realize that, since the human race of one age is not the human race of another age, the reason why Diogenes did not find his man is because he searched among his contemporaries for a man who no longer existed.[62] Cato, he will say, perished with Rome and liberty because he was out of place in his age; and this greatest of men merely astonished a world that five hundred years earlier he would have governed. In short, he will explain how the soul and human passions are imperceptibly altered and, as it were, change their nature; why, in the long run, our needs and our pleasures change their objects; why, with original man gradually disappearing, society no longer offers to the eyes of the wise man anything but an assemblage of artificial men and factitious passions which are the work of all these new relations and have no true foundation in nature. What reflection teaches us on this subject is perfectly confirmed by observation: savage man and civilized man differ so greatly in the depths of their hearts and in their inclinations, that what constitutes the supreme happiness of the one would reduce the other to despair. Savage man breathes only tranquility and liberty; he wants simply to live and rest easy; and not even the unperturbed tranquility of the Stoic approaches his profound indifference for any other objects. On the other hand, the citizen is always active and in a sweat, always agitated, and unceasingly tormenting himself in order to seek still more laborious occupations. He works until he dies; he even runs to his death in order to be in a position to live, or renounces life in order to acquire immortality. He pays court to the great whom he hates and to the rich whom he scorns. He stops at nothing to obtain the honor of serving

them. He proudly crows about his own baseness and their protection; and proud of his slavery, he speaks with disdain about those who do not have the honor of taking part in it. What a spectacle for a Carib[63] would be the difficult and envied labors of a European minister! How many cruel deaths would that indolent savage not prefer to the horror of such a life, which often is not mollified even by the pleasure of doing good. But in order to see the purpose of so many cares, the words power and reputation would have to have a meaning in his mind; he would have to learn that there is a type of men who place some value on the regard the rest of the world has for them, and who know how to be happy and content with themselves on the testimony of others rather than on their own. Such, in fact, is the true cause of all these differences; the savage lives in himself; the man accustomed to the ways of society is always outside himself and knows how to live only in the opinion of others. And it is, as it were, from their judgment alone that he draws the sentiment of his own existence. It is not pertinent to my subject to show how, from such a disposition, so much indifference toward good and evil arises, along with such fine discourse on morality; how, with everything reduced to appearances, everything becomes factitious and bogus: honor, friendship, virtue, and often even our vices, about which we eventually find the secret of boasting; how, in a word, we, who are always asking others what we are and never daring to question ourselves on this matter, who are in the midst of so much philosophy, humanity, politeness, and so many sublime maxims, we have merely a deceitful and frivolous exterior: honor without virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasure without happiness. It is enough for me to have proved that this is not the original state of man, and that it is only the spirit of society and the inequality that society engenders that thus change and alter all our natural inclinations. 
>曾把人类从自然状态引向文明状态的那些道路已经被人遗忘和迷失了，如果细心的读者这样地去发现和追溯这些道路，并根据我刚才指出的那些中间状况，将我因时间匆促而省略了的、或者因想象力所不及而没有想到的那些状况一一用思考把它恢复起来，他们一定会惊讶自然状态和文明状态之间的距离是多么大。正是在事物的这种缓慢递嬗中，他们将可以找到哲学家们所不能解决的伦理上和政治上的无数问题的答案。他们一定会感觉到：此一时代的人类，不同于彼一时代的人类，狄欧若恩之所以找不到人，是因为他想在他同时代的人中找一个已经不存在的那个时代的人。他们也一定会这样说：加东之所以与罗马和自由同归于尽，是因为生错了时代。假使他在五百年前掌握了统治权，这位最伟大的人恐怕是会震惊世界的。总之，读者们将会说明，人类的心灵和情欲是如何在不知不觉的变坏中，变更了它们的本性。也就是说，为什么时间一久我们的需要和我们的乐趣的对象都有了改变；为什么在原始人逐渐消逝的时候，社会，在贤者看来，只不过是一种失去纯朴本性的人和人为的情欲的集合体，而这样的人和情欲乃是所有新生关系的产物，并没有任何真正的天然基础。在这一问题上，我们由思考而知道的东西，已完全被观察所证实。野蛮人和文明人的内心和意向的深处是如此的不同，以致造成文明人至高幸福的东西，反而会使野蛮人陷于绝望。野蛮人仅只喜爱安宁和自由；他只愿自由自在地过着闲散的生活，即使斯多葛派的恬静②也比不上他对身外一切事物的那样淡漠。相反地，社会中的公民则终日勤劳，而且他们往往为了寻求更加勤劳的工作而不断地流汗、奔波和焦虑。他们一直劳苦到死，甚至有时宁愿去冒死亡的危险，来维持自己的生存，或者舍弃生命以求永生。他们逢迎自己所憎恶的显贵人物和自己所鄙视的富人，不遗余力地去博得为那些人服务的荣幸；他们骄傲地夸耀自己的卑贱，夸耀那些人对他们的保护；他们以充当奴隶为荣，言谈之间，反而轻视那些未能分享这种荣幸的人们。一位欧洲大臣那种繁重而令人羡慕的工作，在一个加拉伊波人看来会作何感想呢？这种悠闲的野蛮人宁愿意多少种残酷的死亡，也不愿过这样一种生活，这种生活之可怕，纵然有施展其抱负的快乐，也往往不能得到缓和！而且那个悠闲的野蛮人要了解如此劳神的目的何在，在他的头脑中就必须先具有权势和名望这些词汇的意义；就必须知道有一种人相当重视世界上所有其余的人对他们的看法，而他们所以认为自己是幸福的人并对自己感到满意，与其说是根据自己的证明，毋宁说是根据别人的证明。实际上，野蛮人和社会的人所以有这一切差别，其真正的原因就是：野蛮人过着他自己的生活，而社会的人则终日惶惶，只知道生活在他人的意见之中，也可以说，他们对自己生存的意义的看法都是从别人的判断中得来的①。至于从这样一种倾向中，为什么会产生对善恶的漠不关心，纵然我们有许多谈论道德的卓越文章；为什么在一切都归结为现象的时候，一切都变为人为的和造作的：荣誉、友谊、美德，甚至恶行也不例外，从这一切中，我们终于发现了炫耀自己的秘诀。总之，尽管我们有那么多的哲学、仁义、礼仪和崇高的格言，为什么我们总问别人自己是怎样一个人，而从不敢拿这一题目来问自己。因此我们只有一种浮华的欺人的外表：缺乏道德的荣誉，缺乏智慧的理性以及缺乏幸福的快乐，要说明这一切，都不在我的主题范围以内。我认为既已证明下列两点也就够了，即：上述情况决不是人类的原始状态；使我们一切天然倾向改变并败坏到这种程度的乃是社会的精神和由社会而产生的不平等。

I have tried to set forth the origin and progress of inequality, the establishment and abuse of political societies, to the extent that these things can be deduced from the nature of man by the light of reason alone, and independently of the sacred dogmas that give to sovereign authority the sanction of divine right. It follows from this presentation that, since inequality is practically nonexistent in the state of nature, it derives its force and growth from the development of our faculties and the progress of the human mind, and eventually becomes stable and legitimate through the establishment of property and laws. Moreover, it follows that inequality in status,[64] authorized by positive right alone, is contrary to natural right whenever it is not combined in the same proportion with physical inequality: a distinction that is sufficient to determine what one should think in this regard about the sort of inequality that reigns among all civilized people, for it is obviously contrary to the law of nature, however it may be defined, for a child to command an old man, for an

imbecile to lead a wise man, and for a handful of people to gorge themselves on superfluities while the starving multitude lacks necessities. [65] 
>我已叙述了不平等的起源和进展、政治社会的建立和流弊。我所论述的这些事物，是尽量以仅凭理性的知识就可以从人类本性中推究出来的为限，并未借助于那些对最高权力予以神法上认可的神圣教义。根据我的说明，我们可以断言，在自然状态中，不平等几乎是不存在的。由于人类能力的发展和人类智慧的进步，不平等才获得了它的力量并成长起来；由于私有制和法律的建立，不平等终于变得根深蒂固而成为合法的了。此外，我们还可以断言，仅为实在法所认可的精神上的不平等，每当它与生理上的不平等不相称时，便与自然法相抵触。这种不相称充分决定了我们对流行于一切文明民族之中的那种不平等应持什么看法。因为，一个孩子命令着老年人，一个傻子指导着聪明人，一小撮人拥有许多剩余的东西，而大量的饥民则缺乏生活必需品，这显然是违反自然法的，无论人们给不平等下什么样的定义。
