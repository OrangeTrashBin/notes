### Hardware Designer vs. Computer Architect
- Hardware Designer
    - thinks about circuits, 
components, timing, 
functionality, ease of 
debugging
    - “construction engineer”

- Computer Architect
    - thinks about high-level  components, how they fit 
together, how they work 
together to deliver 
performance.
    - “building architect”
- Why care?
    - You may actually do computer architecture someday
    - You may actually care about software performance 
someday
        - The ability of application programs, compilers, operating systems, etc. 
to deliver performance depends critically on an understanding of the 
underlying computer organization.
        - That becomes more true every year.
          - Up until about 10 years ago, that was primarily due to the increasing 
complexity of the core microarchitecture
         - Since, it is more about the reliance on hardware parallelism and hardware 
heterogeneity
    - You may actually care about computer security
        - Most of the newest and most insidious security attacks have focused 
on microarchitectural details.

### Computer Architecture
- Computer Architecture =
Machine Organization  + 
Instruction Set Architecture
    - Machine Organization: What the machine 
hardware looks like
    - Instruction Set Architecture: How you talk to the machine
- How to Speak Computer

### The Instruction Set Architecture
- that part of the architecture that is visible to the 
programmer
    - opcodes (available instructions)
    - number and types of registers
    - instruction formats
    - storage access, addressing modes
    - exceptional conditions
- It is the agreed-upon interface between all the software that runs on the 
machine and the hardware that executes it.

- The Instruction Execution Cycle
  1. Instruction
Fetch: Obtain instruction from program storage
    2. Instruction
Decode: Determine required actions and instruction size
    3. Operand
Fetch: Locate and obtain operand data
    4. Execute: Compute result value or status
    5. Result
Store: Deposit results in storage for later use
    6. Next
Instruction: Determine successor instruction
- Key ISA decisions
    - operations
      - how many?
      - which ones
    - operands
      - how many?
      - location
      - types
      - how to specify?
    - instruction format 
      - size
      - how many formats?
